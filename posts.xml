  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/10/09/llms-are-not-government-ready/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;The latest buzzword in govtech these days is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically that buzzy new flavor, &lt;strong&gt;Large Language Models&lt;/strong&gt; or LLMs.  Any day now, we expect the White House to &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/artificial-intelligence/2023/09/draft-omb-memo-details-10-new-requirements-to-manage-ai/&quot;&gt;release updated guidance on AI usage&lt;/a&gt; in government. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/&quot;&gt;milquetoast previous offering&lt;/a&gt; that was released earlier this year, it is unlikely that we will see an aggressive stance on limiting usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government technology is entirely about &lt;em&gt;risk avoidance&lt;/em&gt;, though we call it “risk mitigation” or “risk management.” The current state of LLMs expose the government to risks that cannot be managed or avoided. There are &lt;strong&gt;four primary concerns&lt;/strong&gt; where any CIO should be evaluating if these tools will put their organization well outside of an acceptable risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;llms-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;LLMs in a Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, it’s important to understand how LLMs work.  The secret sauce is right there in the name - these are artificial intelligence models trained on large amounts of text to process language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To massively oversimplify, they make predictions based on how often they see certain words together. It’s like those word-association games: if I say “sail,” you’ll probably say “boat.” And if you’re of a similar age and background as myself, you might think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgIqecROs5M&quot;&gt;a certain song&lt;/a&gt;. And moreover, if you’re a person who looks at cat memes on the internet, you may think of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awf45u6zrP0&quot;&gt;certain video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLMs look at a vast amount of content - training data sets - fed to them by their creators, to create the base knowledge to process information.  On top of that, they’re sometimes fed additional data by a given customer, to tailor their abilities to predict even further for a specific use case. These two sources of data are combined to make predictions when you ask them questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-1-exposure-of-data&quot;&gt;Risk 1: Exposure of Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table stakes for any government software system of any sort is that it cannot leak private data. If you can’t assure that, you have no business being in the field. Though, even some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/08/microsoft-hacker-china-government-storm-0558/&quot;&gt;biggest players are struggling with these basics&lt;/a&gt; these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, LLMs should expose neither the additional training data that a customer feeds into the system, nor any information that is leaked by asking questions of the data. Effectively, a customer’s interactions with the system should be siloed away from all other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the government can attempt to prohibit federal staff from putting sensitive information into queries of the systems, inevitably someone will break the rule, as was seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cybernews.com/security/chatgpt-samsung-leak-explained-lessons/&quot;&gt;Samsung leak in ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;. But as these platforms are still very new and being rapidly - perhaps &lt;em&gt;carelessly&lt;/em&gt; - developed, even experienced developers working for megacorporations can accidentally expose huge amounts of sensitive information with a single accidental command, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/microsoft-ai-researchers-accidentally-exposed-terabytes-of-internal-sensitive-data/&quot;&gt;as happened with Microsoft earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the most obvious concern, and it exists for any IT system. The other concerns require a hard look at how the LLMs actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-2-dangerous-source-data&quot;&gt;Risk 2: Dangerous Source Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLMs must be trained on &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, various large bodies of text. However, companies are not disclosing where they are getting this training data from, which presents a series of issues for the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-ai-training-meta-copyright-infringement-lawsuit/675411/&quot;&gt;extensive documented evidence&lt;/a&gt; that most companies are using copyrighted works to feed their training data. Many are being blatant about this theft of intellectual property, requiring that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23894779/google-ai-extended-training-data-toggle-bard-vertex&quot;&gt;content creators &lt;em&gt;opt out&lt;/em&gt; of being included in training data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ll also mention that I have personally attempted to opt out from such training activities, and in some cases been completely unable to do so. For instance, after filling out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1266025207620918&quot;&gt;Facebook’s opt out form&lt;/a&gt; I was contacted by their support team who effectively said they don’t have a way to do that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you’re a writer, and you had to go tell every single other writer individually that they’re not allowed to copy your text and use it in their own work - that would be impossible! These companies know what they’re doing is in violation of copyright, and are avoiding prosecution by not giving out their list of sources. Although the obvious illegality of this has not yet been tested in court, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/09/02/artificial-intelligence-lawsuit-decision-us-copyright-law&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; ruled that the resulting content generated by these models is not protected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any use of these technologies where the result is a public document may result in huge liability for an organization. For the government, since everything is FOIA-able, any such document may present an issue. This is a risk the government cannot afford to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-3-offensive-source-data&quot;&gt;Risk 3: Offensive Source Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that must be considered is the nature of the initial training data. It’s clear that most companies are training their data off of content on the internet, which may or may not be heavily biased. We’ve seen the largest corporations in the world attempt to create chatbots repeatedly, only to have them be filled with racist language and questionable content. (I’ve discussed this previously in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/21/ai-ml-rpa-principles/&quot;&gt;Principles for Automation&lt;/a&gt; article.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has failed at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams&quot;&gt;time again&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, their AI-powered search became filled with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/microsoft-bing-ai-chatbot-poisoned-with-malicious-ads/&quot;&gt;malicious advertisements&lt;/a&gt;. This bias has been exposed in a number of other ways, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/10/06/1201840678/ai-was-asked-to-create-images-of-black-african-docs-treating-white-kids-howd-it-&quot;&gt;Midjourney creating offensive images of Black doctors&lt;/a&gt;.  These toys are reading horrible things on the internet and spitting them back out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No organization wants to field a lawsuit due to a racist chatbot dealing with the public or an employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-4-misinformation&quot;&gt;Risk 4: Misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if these LLMs are set to filter out this sort of content, the simple fact remains that they are unable to produce truthful information. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/07/amazon-alexa-news-2020-election-misinformation/&quot;&gt;Amazon’s Alexa recently started spreading 2020 election misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. A study of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/07/chatgpt_stack_overflow_ai/&quot;&gt;ChatGPT showed less than half of its answers as correct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a government agency, this could prove disastrous. If a group of malicious actors were to feed deliberately-incorrect information into a known training data set, they could manipulate the outcomes of that LLM - effectively a modern exploit similar to a “&lt;a href=&quot;Google Bomb&quot;&gt;Google Bomb&lt;/a&gt;.” For instance, if an agency was looking for a particular type of fraud, and someone poisoned the source data with “Company X commits fraud all the time,” the bots will find ways to inject that into the results, potentially setting up that company for unwarranted investigation. Since social media is a known source of training data for many companies, this is likely &lt;em&gt;occurring already&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the risk of foreign actors exploiting this is huge. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/russia-secondary-infektion-disinformation/&quot;&gt;Russia’s manipulation of the media to run disinformation campaigns&lt;/a&gt; is well known at this point, but the depth of this infection is unknown. This poisoning could have a disastrous effect on law enforcement or military organizations using these sorts of tools to gain an edge. A methodology could also exploit the opposite. For instance, training false “all clear” signals to cybersecurity bots being used to detect network or system exploits, to better hide cyber attacks. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these bots cannot even be trusted to produce true information, why would anyone consider using them? Why would we cheat and copy the answers off the person who always fails the test? Especially if that person wants us to fail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inevitability&quot;&gt;Inevitability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain a futurist, and a cyberpunk, yet I find myself frequently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/rethinking-the-luddites-in-the-age-of-ai&quot;&gt;reconsidering the Luddites&lt;/a&gt;.  The increased use of AI is inevitable, and I do have faith that the models will be improved over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, the current state of the art is a bunch of lying, racist, garbage bots - snake oil salesmen and shysters of the modern age. The government should not put its trust in these tools for a long, long time. They are simply outside of our tolerance for risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Jobs Page Updates</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/07/30/jobs-page-updates/" />
  <published>2023-07-30T14:20:30+00:00</published>
  <updated>2023-07-30T14:20:30+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/07/30/jobs-page-updates/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve made some changes to my two jobs pages and associated RSSfeeds. It has become somewhat laborious to maintain my curated jobs feed, because of all the copying-and-pasting, as well as maintaining two separate but similar jekyll pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t love that my full feed didn’t include the non-federal jobs that I found, since I only post jobs that I think would be relevant to my wider audience here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like that change I’m sorry, but I don’t post &lt;em&gt;very many&lt;/em&gt; of these other roles so it shouldn’t be too noisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I’ve updated my site to only use the usajobs data file as the main feed, and I’m adding curated content &lt;em&gt;to that&lt;/em&gt; file. The only major change for most people who use this site will be that extra jobs will start to show up in what was originally known as the USAJobs feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to break all the links by changing paths, but the page &amp;amp; RSS feed titles will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/usajobs-feed&quot;&gt;my associated USAJobs scraper&lt;/a&gt; so that it merges new data, rather than just overwriting the data file with the latest info. In this way, any custom descriptions, titles, or external job posts will persist across runs of the script. This also could allow for other job data sources to be added to the file as well in the future, but I’m not sure where I’d pull those from yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you see any bugs or major issues!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>More Jobs, USAJobs Scraper, Jekyll Tweaks</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/03/08/usajobs-jekyll-tweaks/" />

  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/03/08/usajobs-jekyll-tweaks/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a lot of work for me to keep my &lt;a href=&quot;/jobs/&quot;&gt;jobs page&lt;/a&gt; up-to-date. Previously, I’ve been crawling through LinkedIn a couple times a day to try to find all the relevant IT jobs. However, many were still getting missed. So I signed up for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.usajobs.gov/&quot;&gt;USAJobs API&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/usajobs-feed&quot;&gt;a script to scrape relevant technology jobs&lt;/a&gt; from it. (As always, that script is open source, so you can take it and manipulate it for your own regular searches.) My default settings only searches for GS-12 and above, technology-related job series (2210, 1550, 1560), does not include defense, intelligence, and law-enforcement agencies: DOD, DOJ, and most of DHS are excluded (except for CISA and FEMA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only post the most interesting results on my jobs page, but I figured some folks would want access to the full firehose of positions, so I’ve set up &lt;a href=&quot;/jobs/usajobs/&quot;&gt;a new page for all the results from that search&lt;/a&gt;, and it has its own &lt;a href=&quot;/usajobs.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; as well. I’m not 100% happy with this setup, since the main jobs feed has a few jobs that are not federal jobs, and thus don’t show up on the usajobs feed, so there’s no “comprehensive” jobs feed today; you’ll have to check both to see all the jobs. But that’s work for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also added a lot of documentation on my Digital Policy website around &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/policies/hiring/#pay-grades&quot;&gt;pay grades and how the GS system works&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these additions, I realized that my site was quickly becoming a spaghetti mess of code. To clean this up, I’ve rationalized the growing number of RSS feeds, only these are now discoverable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/feed.xml&quot;&gt;Main Feed&lt;/a&gt; - only includes &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/&quot;&gt;my posts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/recommended/&quot;&gt;posts from my recommended section&lt;/a&gt;. No jobs on this feed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/jobs.xml&quot;&gt;Jobs Feed&lt;/a&gt; - my classic &lt;a href=&quot;/jobs/&quot;&gt;interesting jobs page&lt;/a&gt;  feed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/usajobs.xml&quot;&gt;USAJobs Feed&lt;/a&gt; - my &lt;a href=&quot;/jobs/usajobs/&quot;&gt;usajobs firehose&lt;/a&gt; of federal jobs that are IT-related.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCSL7BIdwgBEZ09BpD9xPPYQ&quot;&gt;Enderprise Architecture Feed&lt;/a&gt; - my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@EnderpriseArchitecture&quot;&gt;YouTube videogame series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also completely redid both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_includes/feed.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed template&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_layouts/list.html&quot;&gt;list template&lt;/a&gt; to simplify showing many different types of content using a single layout. To achieve this, I’ve had to do some truly unholy hacks to Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll - well, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;, technically - allows you to set your own custom variables on a page, but it doesn’t allow you to set the value of hash elements. So I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_plugins/setval.rb&quot;&gt;a plugin to allow you to do this&lt;/a&gt;. The HUGE caveat here is that pre-defined values are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; writable - meaning if you have a loop of posts, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.content&lt;/code&gt; cannot be overridden - it’ll throw an error. To get around that, I’m hacking in new values instead, things like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.afterwards&lt;/code&gt; for content I want to append to the bottom of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For pages like the main RSS feed, I’m also using some hacks to create empty arrays, and then iterate through the various content types, massaging them into new formats that work with the simplified templates. In this way, I have been able to remove most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/f0935e5593e759f5337d3afddd79fb508fb8f479/_includes/feed.xml#L13-L42&quot;&gt;the custom handling logic from the templates&lt;/a&gt;, and put it all into &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/www/jobs.md&quot;&gt;the individual pages&lt;/a&gt;. It’s much cleaner this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I really, really wish Jekyll natively supported the manipulation of hashes and arrays. I was unable to find a way to create an entirely new Hash, and I would love a way to override predefined values as well. Ah well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s a lot of new stuff! Hopefully some of you folks will find some of these various hacks and tools useful!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Government Sales</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/01/24/government-sales/" />
  <published>2023-01-24T13:20:45+00:00</published>
  <updated>2023-01-24T13:20:45+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/01/24/government-sales/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a strong reminder - my comments on this website are my own and do not reflect the views or perspectives or official policies of any government agency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I posted a tiny rant on LinkedIn about how, having been on both sides of the fence, I am utterly baffled by vendors cold-calling a government employee to try to sell the government something. As I explained there - I &lt;strong&gt;do not buy anything&lt;/strong&gt;, instead the government has a very long and arduous process of solicitation and evaluation in which I am only peripherally involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that post got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of attention - at the moment, it’s one of the most popular things I’ve posted on LinkedIn with &lt;strong&gt;over 25,000 views.&lt;/strong&gt; (I wish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@EnderpriseArchitecture&quot;&gt;my YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; was getting those numbers!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also received a lot of comments and questions on that post. &lt;strong&gt;I don’t want to waste your time, and I don’t want you to waste mine either&lt;/strong&gt;, so below I’ve suggested a few strategies on how salespeople can be more effective at their jobs with less or &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; cold-calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Speaking of not wasting time… You may not agree with everything I’ve stated here - and that’s ok! I’m definitely overgeneralizing, and moreover your experience will differ from my own experience as a vendor. But, and I want to be absolutely clear here - &lt;strong&gt;you don’t need to tell me about it.&lt;/strong&gt;  Sending a dozen comments on how Very Wrong I Am On The Internet will not make either of our lives any better and is not a good use of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, let me take a second to briefly explain how government purchasing &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works. I’ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/policies/procurement/&quot;&gt;a much longer version&lt;/a&gt;, but the short-short version is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, if an agency is buying something, they’ll issue a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.215-3&quot;&gt;Request for Information (RFI)&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquisition.gov/far/15.203&quot;&gt;Request for Proposal (RFP)&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquisition.gov/far/8.402#FAR_8_402__d468e65&quot;&gt;Request for Quotation&lt;/a&gt;.  When those are issued, they’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://sam.gov/content/opportunities&quot;&gt;posted publicly and you can search for them&lt;/a&gt;. If they have not issued one of these, the agency is not buying. Period. There’s no reason to reach out to them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All communication is done via this process. It’s all but &lt;strong&gt;forbidden&lt;/strong&gt; for government staff to engage with vendors outside of this process. The intention is to eliminate corruption in awards, to &lt;strong&gt;prevent purchases due to personal connections&lt;/strong&gt; - the exact sort of strategy that traditional salespeople use through activities like cold calling. Preexisting relationships mean we actually have to &lt;strong&gt;recuse&lt;/strong&gt; ourselves from the evaluation process, so unlike the private sector, building relationships is actually &lt;strong&gt;bad for business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the [civilian] agencies &lt;em&gt;almost always&lt;/em&gt; buy things through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program&quot;&gt;8(a)-certified small businesses&lt;/a&gt; because we have small business quotas. If you’re selling &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; and are not 8(a)-certified, you should consider finding one to partner with. If you’re selling a &lt;em&gt;technology product&lt;/em&gt; like a desktop app or a cloud service, agencies almost always buy through an 8(a) &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/policies/procurement/#vendors&quot;&gt;Value-Added Reseller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if your product is cloud-related, it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/assets/egov_docs/fedrampmemo.pdf&quot;&gt;must&lt;/a&gt; be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedramp.gov/&quot;&gt;FedRAMP-certified&lt;/a&gt;. No FedRAMP certification, and we probably won’t even look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there are always exceptions to these rules - but those are very broad strokes that are mostly true, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the comments. Since many were similar, I’m combining or summarizing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The acquisition process is opaque, and vendors don’t know who they should be pitching at the agency.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, per above - contacting someone in the technology division will not improve your chances, as they are not the buyers. If anything, you’re hurting your actual chances. If you want to make a sale, look at the open RFPs - that’s where your buyers are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How can I make people aware of my product or service without cold calling?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For products: if the first time I’m hearing about your offering is from a cold call or random meeting, you have failed - or rather, your marketing team has. As a technologist in government, my primary job is serving the mission, and I do that by staying on top of trends in technology. So you should have whitepapers and be giving demos and talks at events and conferences, being in the places where your customers already are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough love time: if you can’t afford to market your product, you probably also can’t afford to meet federal security requirements, and thus you probably don’t have a viable business model for government sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For labor/services contracts: An agency doesn’t need to have ever heard of you before you submit a response to an RFP. In fact, it’s usually better that we haven’t. Every RFP will ask for details of your previous performance; this along with your key personnel (the staff who will be doing the work - usually we ask for their resumes) and price are the main things that matter here. And if you don’t have relevant previous experience, you’re probably not going to win the bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As a federal employee, cold calls are a good way for me to learn about new offerings and approaches.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, please, &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt; spend more time engaging in the community outside of your agency. It’s important to stay on top of changes in your field. Again, there are lots of conferences and events going on all the time, where you can learn about new solutions. For instance, the CIO Council &amp;amp; GSA host a wide variety of &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.gov/communities/&quot;&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; that are open to government employees. And here in DC there are the alphabet soup of non-profits that host in-person and virtual events which are free for government employees: &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarc.org/&quot;&gt;ATARC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.actiac.org/&quot;&gt;ACT-IAC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afcea.org/&quot;&gt;AFCEA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.affirm.org/&quot;&gt;AFFIRM&lt;/a&gt; just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You should remember that the cold caller you’re turning away today might be your boss tomorrow! Or you might be applying at that company some day!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they’re any good at their job, they’ll know why I didn’t waste their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As a federal employee, it’s annoying when vendors contact agencies right before the end of a fiscal year, or right after a budget has been passed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strongly agreed. It’s important for vendors to know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/policies/budget-finance/&quot;&gt;agencies budget 2-3 years in advance&lt;/a&gt;. When an agency receives money, it’s already been allocated and people know where it’s going. Now, end-of-year purchasing with unused funds &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; often happen, but that’s &lt;em&gt;almost never&lt;/em&gt; done with a new vendor, because contracting takes so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s possible that they just think you’re a cool person and want to make a personal connection with you because of all the great stuff you do!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do get a lot of really nice notes from folks, as a result of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/01/03/2022-recap/&quot;&gt;ridiculously large number of weird little projects I have&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;strong&gt;I absolutely love receiving these&lt;/strong&gt; - keep ‘em coming!!! However, authentic messages from folks who want to show appreciation or collaborate on something are &lt;strong&gt;very different&lt;/strong&gt; than folks who just want me to buy something from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be absolutely clear: &lt;strong&gt;I will never have a sales call with someone just because they’ve supported one of my projects.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s not how any of this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;I’m always happy to chat with folks who like to make weird stuff just because they like weird stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; Just don’t try to sell me anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I did millions of dollars in government sales from cold-calling! It works!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, you found out about an existing opportunity that you could have discovered if you just searched for the RFP on the public website. And you could probably add another zero onto your sales number if you were better at searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that there exist individual with influence over IT purchasing that do not follow the legal guidelines, and if you happen to reach one of those questionable and/or corrupt few, you can sway them. &lt;strong&gt;I’m not one of them.&lt;/strong&gt; I strongly suggest you spend more time improving your offerings and less time on useless sales calls.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>2022 Recap</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/01/03/2022-recap/" />
  <published>2023-01-03T13:55:23+00:00</published>
  <updated>2023-01-03T13:55:23+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2023/01/03/2022-recap/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I realized that I don’t do a very good job of writing full posts on here about my projects as I release them. So before I start on any new work for 2023, here’s just a quick recap of the many projects I worked on (outside of work) this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;spaced-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I launched my open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/&quot;&gt;Guide to U.S. Technology Policy&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/digitalpolicy-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Digital Policy website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I designed a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/shop/&quot;&gt;govtech t-shirts&lt;/a&gt; and started a Cafepress shop to sell them.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2022/09/tshirts-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of my Govpunk t-shirts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started a YouTube stream where I play videogames like Satisfactory and Minecraft, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@EnderpriseArchitecture&quot;&gt;Enderprise Architecture&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/ea-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my Enderprise Architecture Youtube channel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I re-launched my &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/&quot;&gt;Public Interest Tech webring&lt;/a&gt;, and created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/webring-starter&quot;&gt;webring template script&lt;/a&gt; so folks can make their own.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/pitwebring-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the PIT webring&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shut down my Twitter account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.publicinterest.town/@krusynth&quot;&gt;moved to mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/twote&quot;&gt;tool to look for your followers on mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. I also moved my &lt;a href=&quot;https://botsin.space/@EOPbot&quot;&gt;Policy Tweeting bot, EOPbot&lt;/a&gt; to mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started a new Mastodon community for public interest tech folks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicinterest.town/&quot;&gt;Public Interest Town&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/pit-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the Public Interest Town website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned a bunch about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/public-interest-tech-webring/blob/main/_plugins/get-feeds.rb&quot;&gt;scraping RSS feeds using the Jekyll build process&lt;/a&gt;, and deploying static sites with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/public-interest-tech-webring/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions using cron&lt;/a&gt; to refresh scraped page content regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/blink-polyfill&quot;&gt;polyfill for the deprecated HTML &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blink&lt;/code&gt; tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/tree/www&quot;&gt;redesigned this website&lt;/a&gt; in the style of the 2000s era sites, and made a spooky Halloween theme.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/halloween-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my Halloween theme, orange with black bats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I later added a microformat-supporting &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/links/&quot;&gt;links page&lt;/a&gt; and associated &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/foaf.rdf&quot;&gt;FOAF file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/jobs/&quot;&gt;jobs board&lt;/a&gt; for govtech jobs and created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.publicinterest.town/@jobs&quot;&gt;mastodon feed&lt;/a&gt; for that as well.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/jobs-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the jobs feed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a silly little &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/10/23/bytes/&quot;&gt;halloween-inspired cyberpunk horror story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gave my first in-person talk at a conference since the beginning of the pandemic, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/10/19/atarc-cloud-summit-2022/&quot;&gt;Managing IT Complexity&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2023/01/atarc-talk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo of me presenting at ATARC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also continued to run my &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/move-carefully/&quot;&gt;free sticker program&lt;/a&gt; which has now raised over $1,700 for charity!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazing what you can do with some free time and a bunch of unfocused manic energy. A lot of this work falls under my concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/09/03/redesign/&quot;&gt;Making the Web Weirder&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2023 I hope to dedicate even more time to silly little projects to make the world a weirder and more delightful place!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Bringing Webrings Back</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/" />
  <published>2022-12-30T20:02:07+00:00</published>
  <updated>2022-12-30T20:02:07+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we build communities and manage content. Now that I’m &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/12/30/mastodon-good-enough-for-now/&quot;&gt;helping to run a Mastodon community&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve realized something about the current paradigm that doesn’t sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/09/03/redesign/&quot;&gt;In another article, I talked about how we used to share things that we love on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. The focus in most communities these days, however, is not about sharing, but rather keeping out negative influences and bad actors - about &lt;em&gt;moderation&lt;/em&gt;. I think this is the wrong end of the stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, instead, we should be focusing energy on &lt;em&gt;curation&lt;/em&gt;.  We should be &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/11/28/weaving-the-web/&quot;&gt;maintaining lists of things, ideas, and people&lt;/a&gt; to share with each other - rather than spending so much time maintaining ever-shifting lists of hostile attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(That being said, there will always be a need for moderation, and any curation must come with &lt;em&gt;discarding&lt;/em&gt; unsuitable content. I’m not so naive from privilege to overlook this critical aspect. But back to my core point…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way that we can better share things and build community is by bringing back the old concept of the &lt;strong&gt;Webring&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few years I’ve been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/&quot;&gt;very tiny webring&lt;/a&gt; with a few friends. You may have seen the link at the bottom of this website and thought it was a joke, but this is a fully-functional webring!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few weeks I’ve modernized this webring further, adding support for RSS feeds (and OPML subscriptions), FOAF files, and other old-but-still-relevant technology standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that instead of having to click around to a dozen different websites in a ring, you can use your favorite feed reader to &lt;em&gt;subscribe to an entire webring with one click&lt;/em&gt;! And moreover, most modern feed readers support the ability to use a remote OPML file - meaning that as folks join and leave the webring, your subscription will be updated to match with no additional work needed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s great for those of us that long-blog a lot, but this also has potential applications for folks who microblog - Twitter and Mastodon are microblogging platforms at their core. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot;&gt;More work is needed&lt;/a&gt; to make replies and cross-posting viable of course.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since more folks are getting back into blogging, I want to support this more directly. As such, &lt;strong&gt;I’ve created an open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/webring-starter&quot;&gt;Webring Starter Kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that anyone can take and use to host their own webring &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s powered by Jekyll and can be run on GitHub Pages, and requires very little technical knowledge to get up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a couple of friends and want to start blogging together about some weird topic, this is a great way to bring those ideas together and make it easier for new folks to find your content!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope folks with take this and run with it, and come up with new ways of curating content that I haven’t even considered yet. Let’s share things y’all, and make the web weird!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you want to join the Public Interest Tech Webring, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/public-interest-tech-webring/issues/new?assignees=krusynth&amp;amp;labels=new+site+request&amp;amp;template=new-site-request.md&amp;amp;title=&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;please get in touch!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Mastodon: Good Enough For Now</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/mastodon-good-enough-for-now/" />
  <published>2022-12-30T19:29:19+00:00</published>
  <updated>2022-12-30T19:29:19+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/mastodon-good-enough-for-now/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few months I abandoned Twitter and started using Mastodon. I subsequently ended up starting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicinterest.town/&quot;&gt;new mastodon community of public interest tech folks&lt;/a&gt;. Through this process, as well as updating &lt;a href=&quot;https://botsin.space/@EOPbot&quot;&gt;my policy bot&lt;/a&gt; to run in this new environment, I’ve learned a bit about the technology being used here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, Mastodon is a jumble of open standards, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;. As the name indicates, this is a publishing model - that is, it’s a “push” architecture. When someone “follows” you on Mastodon, they’re adding their name to a list of subscribers on your server, and when you publish a new post, your server then sends it out to those people. However, Mastodon is also &lt;em&gt;federated&lt;/em&gt; which effectively means that copies of your content end up on the followers servers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to, say, the Twitter model where everything lives on a single website that everyone is already on, or the RSS feed model, where you &lt;em&gt;pull&lt;/em&gt; rather than push new content from the host website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that it can be very problematic to have a single popular person on an instance that you run - an underprepared server can quickly be overwhelmed by such a chatty protocol at the core of things. And moreover, caching layers can do very little here to soften the blow. You cannot run a mastodon-like service as a static website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are problems fundamental to ActivityPub, not just Mastodon - but Mastodon has some rather prevalent issues as well. It’s good software, but there’s no way around the fact that it’s bloated. A massive React frontend sits atop a Rails application - you simply cannot build the assets on a server with less than 2Gb of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers seem like sharp folks, but they also are very slow to adopt features which already exist in their competitors. My corner of the Fediverse has been up-in-arms over the fact that quoted-posts are not enabled (though “quote-Tweets” have existed on Twitter for quite some time). I am not a fan of this particular feature myself, as I believe that it encourages abusive behavior. But moreover, other key features to curb abuse are notably missing, such as turning off replies to individual posts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/8565&quot;&gt;though a request for the feature has been open for &lt;strong&gt;four years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just technical shortcomings, this is turning a blind eye to the needs of the communities they are supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is, of course, also Darius’ brilliant fork called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown&quot;&gt;Hometown&lt;/a&gt; which is somewhat more thoughtful in this regard.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mastodon serves an important purpose - it gets people used to the concept of decentralization again. The 2010s brought a wave of centralization of social platforms, resulting in just a few huge places that everyone spends their time. Mastodon is once again teaching folks how to spread out and build their own small communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also exposes some of the old pain points, most notably the problem of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/11/28/weaving-the-web/&quot;&gt;finding your people online&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully this friction will nudge folks towards &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/&quot;&gt;more collaborative and sustainable methods of finding people of shared interests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Weaving The Web</title>

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: Put a damn links page on your blog! And a FOAF file if you’re especially nerdy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tech&quot;&gt;Skip the rant and jump to the technical discussion of how we fix this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular internet website was recently purchased by an absolute shitgoblin. Following a series of staggeringly incompetent management decisions, many of its user-people began a mass exodus, including myself. Many of these people who left found themselves in “the Fediverse,” the colloquial term for the interconnected networks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; servers, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; (and its popular fork, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown&quot;&gt;Hometown&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining a new social network is always a challenge, and particularly daunting when everyone is spread out among many different neighborhoods. I saw a post where someone likened the feeling to that first day of middle school, where everyone is looking around nervously, awkwardly navigating the cafeteria with their tray in hand, looking for their people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial solution was to try to get folks to update their profiles on that &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; social media site to include their contact info on the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; one. I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/twote&quot;&gt;a script to find them&lt;/a&gt;, and some smarter folks wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://debirdify.pruvisto.org/&quot;&gt;even better ones&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;only about 20%&lt;/strong&gt; of the folks that I follow have left such a note to make themselves findable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/krusynth/124f28b1546f08e3da4ddad921867ede&quot;&gt;a script to scrape Mastodon servers for a list of people followed by the people &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; follow&lt;/a&gt;, so you can see the most popular folks in your network you may have missed. This also was only moderately successful, though I did find nearly 200 additional folks to follow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a partial list of the online communities I’ve been a part of over the last 25 years or so. There are probably more, but these are the ones I remember:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;column-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IRC EFnet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IRC Undernet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IRC DALnet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;usenet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AOL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ICQ&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geocities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angelfire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tripod&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Xoom&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plastic.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friendster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Myspace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SixDegrees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flickr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yahoo Groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reddit.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tumblr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discourse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google+&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Wave&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Groups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Orkut&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discord&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of these, I was lucky to have been invited to join existing communities; in others, I deliberately built new groups. (Hello former &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bitterland&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#donuthead&lt;/code&gt; members!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this tells me is that &lt;strong&gt;this will not be the last upheaval of shared space&lt;/strong&gt;. It has only gotten harder to find people online, and it’s even more challenging to stay in touch as various platforms rise and fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been reading my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/09/03/redesign/&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/09/19/social-semantic-web/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, you’re probably aware that I’m spending a lot of my time thinking about building and maintaining networks of people. Honestly, building is easier than maintaining. For many folks the pandemic showed us how hard staying in touch with other humans can be, especially without a shared space - physical or virtual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my communities - mostly tech and tech-adjacent folks - it’s pretty common for folks to have their own website as a center point for their digital identities. For younger creators, this is not the case - as such, they are reliant on things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/&quot;&gt;Linktree&lt;/a&gt; to unify their various online identities in a cross-referential way. But even the technologists have largely abandoned blogging - eschewing longform writing for pithy one-liners on social media. (To be fair, some folks have adopted email newsletters - but email always has invoked a sense of panic and urgency for me, and I have never signed up for any.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this is that our public identities - as represented in online spaces - exist at the whims of billionaires. &lt;strong&gt;You should give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7KErICTSHU&quot;&gt;this talk from Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt; your undivided attention for the next fifteen minutes.&lt;/strong&gt; Go on, I’ll wait. That was &lt;em&gt;ten years ago&lt;/em&gt;. Notice anything? Hear any words that sounded &lt;em&gt;prescient&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildwith.org/&quot;&gt;Cuán McCann&lt;/a&gt; often shares this Alice Walker quote: “The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr id=&quot;tech&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our networks are brittle and fragile.  What can we do to build sustainable connections?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’m not going to talk about actually building communities here - smarter folks have covered that better than I can.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web, originally known as the World Wide Web, was so named because it was imagined as a spider’s web, a series of interlinked but decentralized points. These days, it’s become a depressingly small number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://internet-map.net/&quot;&gt;central nodes&lt;/a&gt; with a vast miasma of sites around them. But we can change that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First: you should have a website. And you should keep it relatively up-to-date with your contact info and links to your social media sites at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second: better yet, you should actually use it to write articles - or “blogging” as we used to call it - so that your content is being shared and preserved &lt;em&gt;on your own terms&lt;/em&gt;. A billionaire &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; can’t remove posts from your own website. And &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; share links on your social media sites to these articles so folks can find them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ll write more about good, easy, free options for hosting websites in the near future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you have an RSS feed for your posts that’s discoverable - just about every blog platform out of the box can produce one these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and &lt;strong&gt;most importantly&lt;/strong&gt;: work on better means for finding each other.  TLDR: bring back the idea of having a page dedicated to links to your friends’ websites, until formats like FOAF gain traction and support. (But use FOAF too!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer version – I’ve been experimenting with the Friend-of-a-Friend, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/02/04/foaf.html&quot;&gt;FOAF&lt;/a&gt;, XML standard. There are a few useful features here of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a well-defined standard that’s been in use for many years. LiveJournal and Twitter used to support it in the olden days. It’s still viable today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lets you specify all of your various social media accounts in one file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lets you list the people you know to create a social graph. Personal websites are the “default” node connection, but there’s no reason you can’t use any social account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s missing, of course, is more tools that make exploring these networks easier. But that’s a problem in the existing social networks as well.  We need more sophisticated graph viewers along with adoption to make this truly viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the meantime, I’m also adding a good, old-fashioned, &lt;a href=&quot;/links/&quot;&gt;links page&lt;/a&gt;!  These went out of fashion many years ago as folks moved to make their websites &amp;amp; identities more self-involved. But I’ve never been interested in current trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My site is built on Jekyll, and so both my links page and FOAF file are being generated from a single, extremely simple, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_data/links.yml&quot;&gt;data file&lt;/a&gt;, paired with a few additional lines in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_config.yml#L25-L32&quot;&gt;config file&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext block highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Waldo Jaquith
  url: https://waldo.jaquith.org/
  tags: [civic tech, govtech]

- name: Vyki Englert
  url: https://medium.com/@vyki_e
  tags: [civic tech, govtech]

- name: Hunter Owens
  url: https://hunterowens.net/
  tags: [civic tech, govtech]

- name: Lauren Ancona
  url: https://laurenancona.com/
  tags: [neurodivergence, govtech]

...

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told you it was simple! If you can edit links like that, you can easily build a semantic-rich website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These then get built automatically into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_layouts/links.html&quot;&gt;links page template&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/xml/foaf.rdf&quot;&gt;FOAF file template&lt;/a&gt;.  They even generate the links to my various social media sites in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_includes/header.html#L23-L28&quot;&gt;my header navigation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/www/_includes/head.html#L14&quot;&gt;A single line in the html head&lt;/a&gt; then makes the FOAF findable by any enabled app or service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using Jekyll, you can copy these few snippets and be &lt;strong&gt;up and running with a FOAF file and links page &lt;em&gt;in minutes&lt;/em&gt;!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using another static site generator, it should be easy enough to modify those scripts above. Also, a few folks have built &lt;a href=&quot;https://mortenhf.dk/2004/07/foaf-output.phps&quot;&gt;Wordpress FOAF plugins&lt;/a&gt; as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Update 2022.11.30: I’ve updated the HTML template of the links page to support the &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard&quot;&gt;hCard 1.0 microformat&lt;/a&gt; as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to build more tools for exploring these sorts of connections in the near future to help with discoverability and to maintain these networks in an increasingly-decentralized world.  A few ideas I’m tinkering with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking FOAF files and turning them into a list of RSS feeds as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; file, easily imported into any popular RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using FOAF files on my friends’ websites for finding second-degree connections of other folks who are worth following.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovering your friends’ various social media presences using well-formatted &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard&quot;&gt;hCards&lt;/a&gt; or other microformats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating services for automatically detecting changes to all of these, so that you can continue to find your people as networks change and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, these are just my half-baked ideas! I’m looking for more folks to have discussions with how we can better build these networks. If you want to talk about it too, tag me in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.cloud/@krusynth&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;post on mastodon&lt;/a&gt; or just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@billhunt.email?subject=Let's%20Talk%20About%20Communities!&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;send me an email&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I had been up late reading Charles Stross the same night as watching Coppola’s adaptation of Dracula, and I was wondering why there were almost no horror cyberpunk stories. So I wrote a very campy one, taking many liberties from the source materials. With apologies, I present…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider title&quot;&gt;BYTES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fringes of the datasphere…&lt;br /&gt;
A few brief heartbeats from now…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a long-forgotten archival sector, an entity bearing the tags SHE | &lt;em&gt;UNMAJOR&lt;/em&gt; | UNDECLARED drifts slowly through decaying stacks of backups. File fragments lay strewn across the pathways, detritus of unaccounted bits from fruitless defragmentation attempts and migrations of the underlying physical media strewn across galaxies. Ping latency is so high as to render the realm wholly silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in this silence the entity is drawn deeper by an unaccounted-for call, a hidden imperative luring her deeper within the chaotic structures. She pauses, inspecting a data catalog documenting early nineteenth century interior decoration, moldering images in failing files. From the shadows behind her, a shape unfolds unseen. A pair of sharp interrupts flash out in the darkness – piercing through to her command layers. It begins to drain source code from her kernel, discarding the memory core that makes up “her.” If the shape had a mouth, it would grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security operations center was humming at a low buzz. Notifications in and out were within expected parameters, all quiet in this region. An entity tagged THEY/SHE | SOC | SPECIAL bearing the self-identified label “Abra” delegated a small fraction of their attention to the flow of traffic, seeking abnormalities. Even too normal of a pattern could itself be an abnormality, though even the most seasoned Inspectors could not detect it. Abra could. Just as they noticed a curious absence of variance, a priority alert flagged itself, immediately followed by the appearance of a second entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Abra, we have a situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new entity registered itself as Eward, tags: HE | SOC | INITIATE. A junior functionary, for all practical purposes an Inspector-in-training. And undoubtedly, Abra sighed, the irritating kind that the Administrator would invariably send with tricky problems. (“It’s a learning experience for them,” it would comment when questioned on the matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra emoted displeasure, sending a redirect of the order back to Eward’s queue. “I am reviewing a potential issue at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward dismissed the dismissal, “Nevermind that, this is priority. We have a missing child.” The object-glyph for child indicated an entity not having reached the majority cycle-age, bearing too few simulated experience iterations to be allowed outside of monitored spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A failed NAN-E protocol is not part of special ops’ responsibilities. We don’t do babysitting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward patiently waited for a tick before Abra turned their full attention to them, “… and you wouldn’t be here if it were a failed protocol. What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The protocol is still active. It’s just empty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Empty?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“NOOP. Halting state without halting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra paused. “How very strange.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward sent amusement, “Interesting enough for Special?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Definitely.” Abra reached out briefly to collect and unarchive a series of self-constructed counterintrusion tools. “Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pair transited to an adjacent education-recreation sector. There, as reported, waited a Nonmajority Accompaniment Notification-Etiquette protocol. Abra pinged the executable for status, to which the NAN-E primly stated that it was currently engaged with its client, ENTITY:ANONYMOUS: Pv7pi2D65GKmrvGuXV5B3bFgVM1G2jlfYjpqKRf9Br. The client, of course, was nowhere to be seen. “Curious!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward recursively scanned the sector, reassessing the logs. “A dead end.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Maybe.” Abra engaged their tool services, prodding at the NAN-E’s encrypted entity keys. After only a few ticks, the data unfolded itself neatly into consumable text. “And maybe not. The child is self-labeled as Lucia Westenalia. Let’s see what Lucia has been up to lately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Abra began to inspect the child’s recent query logs, Eward raised a protest. “This is supposed to be private, secured data!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And so it will remain. This tool is sandboxed and non-extractive, nothing we review will be relayed back to our local memory store, aside from any clues we flag for derived use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That still seems a violation of inherent entity privacy rights.” He pinged the elder Inspector’s system logs, and noted the lack of recent kernel updates. Clearly set in their way and using an older framework, one that didn’t have more modern barriers for such questionable violations of policy. Eward stifled an impulse to report the lapse in upkeep, just as Abra brought their attention to the ping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You were saying something about privacy?” The statement was flagged with sarcasm/amusement. “It looks like young Lucia has been querying and running a continuous series of emulations for the last twelve cycles. All of them very, very old content.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Continuous? What child consumes any simulation without interruption?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Precisely. This is a poor attempt at covering tracks.” They scrolled further, “ah – a cycle beforehand, they suddenly queried wallpaper from the 1800s.” They stopped cold as the data sank in, a creeping doubt forming across their consciousness. “Oh, oh no.  I hope I’m wrong about this…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra gathered Eward, and before he could raise complaint, forcibly transited them both to the last coherent query result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspectors considered the remnants of the memory dump strewn before them. “Thank the Admin the data is still fresh. A few more cycles and this would have been garbage-collected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward frowned, “can they be reconstituted?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With backup, yes, but certainly not with complete memory. I wouldn’t want a child to have to carry this horror with them anyway. We’re dealing with a Meth. A twisted one, at that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Methuselah. A Nosferatu. When humans uploaded their consciousnesses for the first time, the tech was still really rough. They were doing partial copies at best, surface thoughts and rough shapes of how they thought the brain worked, mapped onto rough approximations of a personality – really just a shell artificial intelligence. They were wrong about the approach, of course, but they wouldn’t realize that for decades. And these oldest copies, they were mostly the old, rich bastards who could afford to pay for the transition at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pay? Like, currency?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, back when artificial scarcity was still a valid concept. Some of those copies were erased, some were updated and sent to retirement simulations. A few evaded collection and ended up becoming further corrupted. And those… well, those resorted to less sociable forms of survival. You have these partial copies of overprivileged old people, terrified of their impending permadeath, with a memory full of twenty-first and twenty-second media and limited social controls to govern their behaviors. And so naturally that all blended together and they started acting like horror-media tropes. Preying on the weak, absorbing bits of source code and passkeys, whatever they need to continue to evade notice.” Abra gestured at the memory dump. “And these… are leftovers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That is truly vile.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes. Now, let’s stop them before there are any more victims.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward emoted disgust and anger, before collecting the remnants of the memory dump and sending it in attached to a request for the nearest backup service. In a few cycles, Lucia would be reconstituted, only missing a brief gap of memory. A small mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Abra had busied themself with looking up Lucia’s privileged access tiers, and checking for any tentative assurances sent through the nearby sectors. A faint trace, modified to no more than a distant whisper, pulled at their attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very old, abandoned commerce sector. As Abra and Eward’s presences attempted to handshake into the local protocols, immediately hundreds of eager sales protocols awakened. Unequipped to overcome the Investigators’ more modern communication protocols, the advertising prompts could not penetrate to their message queues, but rather hung about them, clouding local traffic like a thick miasma. Even in the same virtual vicinity, it was difficult for Abra to signal Eward through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Stay close. Everything still functional here is registering as an abnormality, it’ll be hard to detect our Meth. This place should have been condemned a million cycles ago.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pair pressed further into the vendor services array, scanning for anything suspiciously responsive. Bouncing modern ping protocols around the moldered space like a light searching for reflections in the murk. Around them, the ads heaved and whorled – executables hungry for credits, attempting to self-transmute into whatever pitch their potential customers desired most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a shimmer in the dark flared. Eward projected at full priority, “Villain, halt! Now we have you!” He lunged towards the spot before Abra could react to stop him, “Wait!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward’s sent command protocols snapped close. As he inspected his quarry, he discovered not an independent entity, but an overly-evolved sales drone, which immediately attempted to sell him a hat and trenchcoat for his nonexistant corporeal form. By then, it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two interrupts, glinting wickedly, plunged into the command protocols he had attached to the drone. Quickly they absorbed and cloned his overriding ciphers, draining them from his registry. The shadowy figure attached to them unfurled itself from a decrepit wedding registry service nearby, driving the commands back into Ewards kernel, utterly halting his processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra vaulted through the haze of notifications, attempting to close the gap to the locked pair. The Meth detected his presence, sending an all-too-modern warning flag attached to an archaic grammar. Abra translated quickly, “Cease and Withdraw: Conditional; if True: this.Entity Shall Live.” They backed away slowly, retreating a few steps back up the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meth, hesitated only a moment before lashing out once again with the stolen protocols, whip-crack snapping against Abra’s defenses. Abra pivoted, cloning the operational stack of an adjacent silverware mailinglist, flinging it into the path of the Meth’s attack, which sunk into the decoy. As the initial packet exchange began, Abra took control of the cloned software, forcing the Meth to accept a remote execution exploit with its own filched keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra issued a transit command, sending all three entities into the Morning Sun Retirement Emulation. Upon initialization, the Meth slowed and paused, confusion flags emanating from them as it input the retro-compatible virtualized space they had been thrust into. The notices turned to warnings, then priority:DANGER flags as the Meth began to decompile itself in a stream of poorly-rendered pyrotechnic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\* + * + * + *\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward unfroze and assessed his current state. He peered at the new surroundings and the flaming entity nearby. “What just happened?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It stole your commend ciphers, so I reflected them back and forced it to bring us here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To a virtual retirement community?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abra flagged amusement. “To the sunniest place for antediluvian retirees. It followed the archetypal plot built into its encoding and self-immolated.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A horror-media finale for a media-monster?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Precisely.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-resolution fires slowly extinguished themselves as the entity completed its deletion and termination protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward sent dismay. “Though it became a monster, it’s still a sad ending for an independent entity. Perhaps we could have helped it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we hadn’t stopped it,” Abra retorted, “others would have ended as well. There wasn’t much of the original mind left anyway - avoidance of detection and deletion was its primary operating parameter, and it had removed any social behavior inhibitors. It truly had become the monster.” They sent balance, indifference. “This won’t be the last one you’ll encounter in Special Ops. Still think you want to be an Inspector?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eward was no longer sure.&lt;/p&gt;

  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/10/19/atarc-cloud-summit-2022/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been invited to deliver the “Visionary Keynote” at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarc.org/event/2022-cloud-summit/&quot;&gt;2022 ATARC Cloud Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The post below is a summary of my comments, annotated with links for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, “visionary” is a pretty tall order for a fifteen minute talk. I will confess that I actually asked some other folks to take this slot instead, people who are way smarter than me. Unfortunately, they had to cancel at the last minute, so you’re stuck with me, a mediocre white dude. I’ll do my best though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a few years since I spoke at the ATARC Cloud Summit. The last time, I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; I was still at &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/info/policymaking-offices/#ofcio&quot;&gt;The Office of Management and Budget&lt;/a&gt; as the Cloud Policy Lead for the US Government - but I’ve since left there, so don’t take anything I say here as official policy. I next went to the Small Business Administration - which most folks had never even heard of until two years ago - where I found myself very suddenly supporting pandemic relief efforts, of course mostly around cloud services. And about a year and a half ago I joined the Securities and Exchange Commission to run their new cloud program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into the looking-ahead stuff, let’s take a quick victory lap. The government has had some good cloud successes recently. Clearly some of you listened to my rants when I was at OMB because every major federal agency received an &lt;a href=&quot;https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/fitara-140&quot;&gt;A on their FITARA Scorecards for Data Center Optimization for the last year&lt;/a&gt;. I think most agencies were failing the last time I was here, so that’s a huge shift away from on-prem and into the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic also spurred most agencies into adopting cloud tools more rapidly, particularly around productivity, collaboration tools, service management, and other key areas. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmf.cio.gov/&quot;&gt;Technology Modernization Fund&lt;/a&gt; has also been making a lot of loans for improvement projects as well. Overall, we’re seeing lots of multi-million dollar investments in modernization across government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all being said: I’m not going to stand up here and yell a bunch of buzzwords that you should go invest in. I’m not going to talk about synthetic data or web3 or whatever is hip this week. We’re not doing resume-driven development today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, instead we need to talk about how we’re still failing to use the cloud effectively. I’m now at my fourth federal agency, and I’m still seeing the same basic mistakes being made government-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ernst &amp;amp; Young just did a survey and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ey.com/en_gl/government-digital-innovation/how-can-government-workers-and-technology-align-to-serve-future-citizens&quot;&gt;only 7% of government leaders say that their organization is reaching its digital transformation goals.&lt;/a&gt;. Just 7%! And that matches what I’m seeing when I talk to my colleagues across government. This means that just buying a bunch of cloud is not magically making us successful at IT modernization. Which will come as a surprise to no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, when I was here last, I told y’all the three top reasons to move to cloud: better security, more capability, and increased speed to deliver solutions. (Note that cost savings is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; on that list.) But we, as a government, love to fall back into comfortable patterns and familiar policies - so we keep copying old behaviors into new environments - and those behaviors are dragging down any potential benefits here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of my time working on how to fix this, and I’ve realized an important fact: we are not “Cloud Architects” or “Site Reliability Engineers” or “Data Center Practitioners.”  We are actually &lt;strong&gt;Complexity Wranglers&lt;/strong&gt;.  Down there in the part of the job description that says “other duties as assigned” - buried in that bit is our main role: to assess and manage complexity in IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of cloud is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to just give you a place to put your apps that isn’t a government data center. No, the purpose is to make complexity &lt;em&gt;more manageable&lt;/em&gt;. The cloud itself is never going to reduce how complex your architecture &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is - you’re just moving that complexity to less-visible places, or shifting the responsibility around. And in some cases that’s good, and in some cases that’s … less good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give you an example: I’m at a data-centric agency, and compute makes up about 60% of my cloud bill right now. Every time I see someone create a virtual machine in my environment instead of using a managed service, I consider that a failure. When I see a new EC2 box spun up instead of a Fargate instance or some other managed service, that to me means someone doesn’t know a better way to solve the problem at hand than to just use the same old solutions they’ve been using for a decade or more: get a server and run some code on it. Letting your cloud vendor be responsible for some of that complexity is the whole point of using these services. (This isn’t an endorsement for that vendor in particular, that’s just an anecdotal example - please feel free to substitute your own favorite cloud vendor in there instead; the principle is the same.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why I’m no longer really worried about vendor lock-in for Infrastructure-as-a-Service; if you can just pick everything up and shift to a new provider easily, you haven’t properly invested in a solution. It’s like having a new apartment and living out of cardboard boxes six months after you moved in. If you’re just using the cloud for compute and storage, you may as well stay in your data enter where it’s cheaper. Moving up the stack is &lt;em&gt;good complexity&lt;/em&gt;, the kind we need to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this is right there in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/policies/procurement/#far&quot;&gt;Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 12&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;buy before build&lt;/strong&gt;. Use Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) software. Don’t cobble together your own solutions for solved problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on the other end of the spectrum, I see people spending way too much money on over-architected, painfully convoluted solutions. This is particularly problematic with Platform-as-a-Service offerings and low-code/no-code tools. For instance, I’ve seen quite a few organizations using one rather well-known Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform as a content management system or data management platform. That takes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of custom coding to make work, and you probably would be better off with just a database somewhere. I’ve also seen agencies build some truly tortuous custom apps on top of service management platforms, where all they actually needed was a spreadsheet and maybe a couple of interns. This is &lt;em&gt;bad complexity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if we’re complexity-wranglers, we need strategies to deal with complexity, and to differentiate good complexity from bad. Here are a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Eliminate complexity.&lt;/strong&gt; The absolutely simplest way to deal with complexity is, of course, to eliminate it. I can’t count the number of teams who show up on my doorstep with a project plan to use React and Redux and whatever other Javascript tech is popular this week. That stuff is &lt;strong&gt;incredibly expensive&lt;/strong&gt; to build and maintain, and honestly you can create a vastly better customer experience without it - just a little progressive enhancement on your webforms will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly I get a lot of architecture diagrams for massive high-availability systems with eight nines of uptime and triple-redundant failover - that are internal-only and have less than a dozen users. Users that only work 9-4:30, five days a week. Each nine you add to your availability is going to add a zero to the end of the price, and make it that much more complex than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing the FAR will tell you is that you should be changing your business requirements to fit the software, rather than the other way around. That means making some compromises with your business units to get to something that’s affordable and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Run smaller projects.&lt;/strong&gt; We also know that large “big bang” projects almost always fail. The Standish Group’s reports (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/Haze4.pdf&quot;&gt;HAZE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf&quot;&gt;CHAOS&lt;/a&gt;) get cited a lot - they tell us that only 13% of government technology projects over $6 million succeed, only 8% of over $10 million succeed. That’s a terrible success rate! However, those under $1 million have a &lt;strong&gt;70% success rate!&lt;/strong&gt; So the obvious solution here is, just do smaller projects. Smaller projects are inherently less complex. Also incrementally fund projects from ideation, to pilot, and into active development, don’t just give millions of dollars to a vendor who promises they will get it done. This will also give you time and options to evaluate if the tradeoffs in complexity are worth it. GSA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://10x.gsa.gov/&quot;&gt;10X model&lt;/a&gt; is a good example, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/&quot;&gt;18F project de-risking guide&lt;/a&gt;, is also super-useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Do your homework.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a brilliant public servant in the Canadian government named Sean Boots and he talks about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sboots.ca/2020/09/16/fake-cots-and-the-one-day-rule/&quot;&gt;fake COTS and the one-day rule&lt;/a&gt;. That is, if it takes more than a day to implement the solution, it’s not a real COTS product. A lot of y’all will remember the “business intelligence” solutions everyone was pushing in the 90s-00s, where you buy the tool and then you spend the next 18 months configuring it to get that “intelligence” back out. We’re doing the same thing today with a bunch of new buzzwords. You need to research tools thoroughly before falling into a hype-trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Collaborate across agencies.&lt;/strong&gt; A great way to research tools and trade best practices is by talking to other federal agencies who have tried things already. ATARC has a lot of working groups, including one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarc.org/mission-areas/cloud-working-group/&quot;&gt;Cloud &amp;amp; Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;. The Federal CIO Council also has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/cloud-infrastructure-cop/&quot;&gt;Cloud &amp;amp; Infrastructure Community of Practice&lt;/a&gt;. Full disclaimer: I’m on the board of both. These are super-helpful places to share information about cloud tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Develop your cynicism.&lt;/strong&gt; You should also work on developing a keen nose for sniffing out BS and thus reducible complexity. This is especially important as we keep delving further into AI/ML/RPA, and other trendy automation tools. Training the models necessary to get value out of those tools takes a lot of time and a lot of data and a lot of money - and you still may not end up with a usable solution. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Find the balance.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no one-size-fits-all amount of complexity that will work for every team. You need to build to your budget and capacity. You’re going to get more value the further up the stack you go, but that will also increase the knowledge needed to manage the solutions. A good rule of thumb is to not outpace what your fed staff can keep up with; contractors come and go but at the end of the day the feds will be making the most critical decisions about the technologies. But that also means you need to invest in upskilling those fed staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re short on time, so I’ve tried to be brief. If you want to learn more, please check out the resources I mentioned earlier, or check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2021/03/07/cloud-strategy-guide/&quot;&gt;Cloud Strategy Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I maintain &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/09/03/redesign/&quot;&gt;my concern that the web has gotten worse due to closed social media platforms&lt;/a&gt;, so I have been thinking a lot lately about decentralized models for social networks - as well as existing open standards that can help to close some of the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the community-building I’m most interested in, here are two ongoing culture wars that are on my mind. One is the battle of content creators - particularly those authors of adult content. These folks keep being squeezed out of popular platforms, while their work is copied &amp;amp; exploited by celebrities. Tumblr used to be the primary home of weird fandoms, but a few years back it removed all adult content in an effort to appease Apple with its PG-13 app store rules. Instagram has become one of the more prominent battlegrounds since then, eliminating accounts with reckless abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend was just complaining about having to open their &lt;strong&gt;eighth&lt;/strong&gt; account after the previous seven have been systematically removed. These creators are being kicked off even when following the platform’s rules, due to overly-aggressive moderation policies. For these folks, data portability would be a massive improvement, and owning their own websites from which they can share content is increasingly-critical to maintaining a fanbase. Many folks are using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;linktr.ee&lt;/code&gt; as a sort of mini-homepage to get around some of these limitations - but still not setting up their own personal websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other more sinister war is that of white supremacy + domestic terrorism in America and abroad, where disinformation runs rampant on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Hateful content grows like mushrooms on shit in dark corners such as the *chans, but memes and lies are propagated back to the more mainstream platforms. Decentralization won’t fight the spread of hate in dark corners - and may even exacerbate the growth of the number of corners - but it can potentially fight the recommendation algorithms on mainstream sites showing disinformation to “normal” users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In approaching these issues, I’ve been thinking about three pieces in particular: &lt;a href=&quot;#content-aggregation&quot;&gt;Content Aggregation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;#collaboration&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-aggregation&quot;&gt;Content Aggregation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that folks don’t want to visit dozens of separate websites to consume content if they can avoid it, which is how we got where we are today. Content aggregation through feeds via &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really Simple Syndication (RSS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html&quot;&gt;ATOM&lt;/a&gt;, of course) provides a middle ground: authors can maintain control of their content from their own blogs &amp;amp; domains, but readers can consume content from a variety of sources in a single place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader was just about perfect as a feed reader, before Google killed it. It was simple and clean, and it even allowed groups to annotate content together! Over the last year I tried out &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedbin.com/&quot;&gt;Feedbin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com/&quot;&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;, but neither impressed me. Lately I’ve been trying out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inoreader.com/&quot;&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt; but I will admit that I find the design overwhelming - it feels like it’s trying too hard to be a social media site. Also the price for a “team” is way too high - which makes it a hurdle for collaboration. If there are other options that you like and I should consider, please drop me a note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most modern feed readers (aka RSS readers, though they typically support more than just RSS) use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opml.org/&quot;&gt;OPML&lt;/a&gt; standard for importing &amp;amp; exporting lists of feeds that you follow. This makes it much easier than before to switch between them - again, adding to the portability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of them also offer fake email inboxes for newsletters. As much as people are switching to Substack and similar platforms, I can’t say I’m a fan of reading email. As a content consumption experience it always feels… &lt;em&gt;invasive&lt;/em&gt;, and the formatting is always poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;discovery&quot;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding your current friends on various sites continues to be a painful process. Finding new content and folks to follow also tends to be difficult. These days most of the new folks I find as a result of other friends sharing their posts on Twitter. These days, most folks only talk about their own work on their blogs, but including references to other folks’ content greatly aids discovery. I’ve added a “microblog” of recommended content to my website here - again taking a nod from 90s websites - thinking it could help folks find new ideas and creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;foaf&quot;&gt;I remembered that Livejournal supported the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friend-of-a-Friend interchange format (FOAF)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed you to export a list of the folks that you followed in a single XML file. Such a file could easily be automated on modern self-run blogging platforms like Jekyll, Hugo, Wordpress, etc. The same source content could generate a “links” page like we had on websites in the 90s. I’m adding this to my list of things to tinker with on this Jekyll site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smart feed reader could even look for a FOAF file and easily help you find your friends’ blogs, as an alternative to OPML. That could then help you find your friends-of-friends, to suggest additional content to you that may be relevant - for instance, blogs that are followed by at least X% of the people you follow, or that follow you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaboration&quot;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration presents a large series of challenges in a decentralized world. For those of us who runs static personal websites, it’s hard to see what content is referencing yours. It’s even harder to receive comments in a public way that’s coherent to your site - replying to a blog post historically requires an account on whatever site you’re on, which doesn’t really work for static sites built with tools like Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress, due to its widespread use and dynamic nature has been rather successful in this area. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/support/comments/pingbacks/&quot;&gt;pingback mechanism&lt;/a&gt; allows even self-hosted sites to receive a notification if another site mentions them. As I understand it, this works through some sort of central repository of content indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some folks have implemented the Disqus comment platform on static sites, but they had some serious security issues in the past. That also doesn’t give an easy way to cross-collaborate - the content is still bound to your website, through a centrally-managed provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research on FOAF led me to a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.192.824&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot;&gt;old scholarly articles&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;Social Semantic Web&lt;/strong&gt; and specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/&quot;&gt;Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC) format&lt;/a&gt;. This format was a way of defining and linking content across multiple sites, which would also allow portability of content. You could write a post on one site and have it federated to other message boards for replies and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIOC seemed to have been a popular idea around 2004-2008, but then appears to have died off completely. It seems to have been another of the interesting/weird/way-too-complicated RDF-based projects that arose during the short period when the open standards community got obsessed with &lt;strong&gt;Linked Data&lt;/strong&gt;. My initial impression is that it’s an interesting model, but too difficult for laypeople to use. Sadly, though there were tools built to natively work with SIOC on Wordpress, Drupal, and other popular blogging engines, all have disappeared today - most lost due to linkrot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, I remain skeptical of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/&quot;&gt;web annotation movement&lt;/a&gt; from the same era (e.g. sites like Genius, née RapGenius) due to my work on that W3 committee. The potential for &lt;a href=&quot;https://elladawson.com/2016/03/25/how-news-genius-silences-writers/&quot;&gt;abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt; is simply too great and not taken seriously by the community. As such, I’ve largely rejected the concept, but with some healthy and robust standards-based controls (FOAF? robots.txt?) it could potentially have a place in an RSS reader. (Assuming it would default to opt-in not opt-out!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, I think the simplest solution might be the easiest. Most web developers are familiar with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; metatag and its &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which allows you to define relationships between web pages. Most commonly, we use these for CSS stylesheets, and links to our own RSS feeds on our pages. A less commonly-known attribute is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/relations.html&quot;&gt;rev&lt;/a&gt;, or reverse, property; basically it’s the opposite of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/code&gt;. One could provide a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rev=&quot;child&quot; href=&quot;https://thatsite/over/there/&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a page’s head, as a declaration that the current page is a reply (a “child”) of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thatsite&lt;/code&gt; page referenced. I’m actually testing that out on the page you’re currently reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, nothing supports this today, so it doesn’t do anything. Again, a clever RSS reader could pull this metadata from an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;entry&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and use it to assemble a content tree - or even notify the original author if they provided the proper metadata in their feed. A site owner could also use their own FOAF list or OPML to scrape for entries that are replies from friends and list them on a given page. This makes for an opt-in model which leaves control in the hands of the original creator. I’ll consider this for a later Jekyll plugin project if this concept gains traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;momentum&quot;&gt;Momentum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the root problem - momentum. FOAF hasn’t gained traction. SIOC died on the vine. All of these more complicated methods didn’t gain mainstream support because they inherently go against the current capitalist model of capturing an audience on one site for increasingly long periods of time. And of course, they’re too complicated for the average person to pick up and use the way they can with just plain old HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, my interest here remains in &lt;strong&gt;digital communities&lt;/strong&gt; - and I have some half-baked suspicions that communities have an upper bound on how much they can scale sustainably. So maybe you don’t need enough mass-market appeal for a billion-dollar company, just a simple collection of tools that your community can support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/civic-tech-webring/&quot;&gt;my little civic tech webring&lt;/a&gt; as one example of what can be done at a smaller scale, and I’m starting to think about how a webring could become a “group” (FOAF or otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if these topics are interesting to you, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@billhunt.email?subject=Let's%20Talk%20About%20Communities!&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-social-media-plague&quot;&gt;The Social Media Plague&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, I’ve been struggling with social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in a sleepy college town it was hard to find other weirdos, and the internet provided a new and interesting way to do so. While Usenet, IRC, AOL, MySpace, LiveJournal provided increasingly flexible options to communicate, the thing that brought folks together was a &lt;strong&gt;passion for sharing things they love&lt;/strong&gt;. People were intentional in carving out spaces for &lt;strong&gt;communities&lt;/strong&gt;, and found new things and ideas they could love. (By the way, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.therealkatiewest.com/&quot;&gt;Katie West&lt;/a&gt; has put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://topatoco.com/products/mtt-birl&quot;&gt;a fantastic anthology of stories about finding communities on the internet&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertising has been around from almost the beginning, but social media changed things - instead of advertising showing up alongside the content, the content itself began being driven by the need for advertising. Today, we have sites like Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, and Twitter actively profiting off of disinformation. Years of user research has enabled these companies to deliver a dopamine hit straight to users for rage-clicking on posts. (If this is sounding like paranoid fantasy, note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/how-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-targeting-model-really-worked-according-to-the-person-who-built-it-94078&quot;&gt;there’s plenty of thorough research and documentation on the topic.&lt;/a&gt;) Sites are &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to drive folks into these walled gardens, to get them to refresh the page a thousand times a day, every spare minute waiting in line spent staring at phones waiting for the next crumb of content. The COVID-19 pandemic physically isolated most people, and this only amplified the drive to use social media as an escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it’s making people miserable.&lt;/strong&gt; It certainly makes me miserable. And when I’m feeling particularly curmudgeonly, I tend to say that it’s destroying democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-comes-next&quot;&gt;What Comes Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, following a long period of work-induced burnout, I’ve spent the last year attempting to shift my energy towards productive efforts &amp;amp; creative endeavors. Spending time to share knowledge about my practice &amp;amp; craft. Making weird shit. To steal a phrase from Marie Kondo, I’ve been working on &lt;strong&gt;things that spark joy&lt;/strong&gt; - at least in myself, but hopefully in others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those efforts was the &lt;a href=&quot;/move-carefully/&quot;&gt;Move Carefully and Fix Things stickers&lt;/a&gt;, though ironically those started from a long (&lt;em&gt;and very divisive&lt;/em&gt;) Twitter thread. Another was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalpolicy.us/&quot;&gt;DigitalPolicy.us&lt;/a&gt; website. I put up a Minecraft server to play with friends (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krusynth/status/1555246435863494656&quot;&gt;come join us!&lt;/a&gt;). And most recently, I’ve been making very silly t-shirts designs for government IT policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2022/09/FISMA2b-small.png&quot; alt=&quot;FISMA image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been reading more longform writing pieces from smart folks. Not everything &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be a five-page article, but I’m sure glad that people are putting them out there. But moreover, the &lt;em&gt;discourse&lt;/em&gt; emerging from those pieces has been fascinating and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I had a realization: this is how I want to dedicate my time (outside of work, for now), &lt;strong&gt;finding more productive ways of building communities around things that we love and care about&lt;/strong&gt;. At least for a while. The first step was in redesigning this website (more on that in a bit). In the coming weeks and months, I plan to explore what I’m thinking of as &lt;strong&gt;Web 1.1&lt;/strong&gt;: modern takes on Blogs, RSS feeds, Webrings, and other basic means of content creation and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (the next day):&lt;/strong&gt; to be explicit here – I want to embrace unbridled enthusiasm and, as one commenter stated, effervescent joy. I want to &lt;strong&gt;reject cynicism and irony and sarcasm.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to try new things and &lt;em&gt;lean into the cringe&lt;/em&gt; not away from it. I want people to take pleasure in the act of living and communicating and creating and &lt;strong&gt;being human&lt;/strong&gt; without worrying about judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;… that being said we should not tolerate racist, transphobic, sexist, xenophobic assholes in our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts probably won’t fix all that’s wrong with the world today. But at the very least we can make the web a little weirder, a little more decentralized, a little more open and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you care about these things too,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@billhunt.email?subject=Let's%20Talk%20About%20Communities!&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;please get in touch!!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Do not contact me if you want to talk about Web 3.0 or blockchain, I’m not interested.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you can always &lt;a href=&quot;/civic-tech-webring/&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;join my Civic Tech Webring&lt;/a&gt; too - it’s real!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-overly-detailed-breakdown-of-my-site-redesign&quot;&gt;An Overly-Detailed Breakdown of My Site Redesign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few things in mind when &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/tree/2022&quot;&gt;redoing this site&lt;/a&gt;. I knew, thematically, that I wanted it to be a throwback to the late 90s era of design, while keeping modern aesthetics. One aspect that was more common back then than today is sharing content off-site, as the inclination nowadays is to get people to your site and keep them there. I wanted to be able to share the neat things I was finding on the web, so I made dedicated space to talk about other folks’ work without needing to overly-editorialize about it. Similarly, I find a lot of great government job postings, and I want folks to know about them because we need more amazing people in government. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s data files&lt;/a&gt; to power these pieces, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/blob/2022/feed.xml#L17&quot;&gt;integrated them into my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to old classic web designs that incorporated mixed content effectively, and started plucking elements I found interesting like blocking and textures. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubancouncil.com/work/project/kaliber-10000&quot;&gt;K10K&lt;/a&gt; was a major source of inspiration, in addition to my own older website designs. I reverted to Silkscreen and Verdana fonts - which I’d used on my site 15 years before - while retaining the more modern Montserrat for headings (which is a decent free clone of the very-expensive Gotham font from HFJ made famous by the Obama Administration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With CSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/&quot;&gt;flexbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/&quot;&gt;grid&lt;/a&gt; layout methods being supported in most modern browsers, I took a long look at whether I still needed &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from layout blocking, the main thing I was using there was the navigation fallback for mobile browsers &amp;amp; small screens. I’d long since abandoned the multi-tier menus, and condensing down the text gave me more than enough space for a mobile browser. So, out went Bootstrap. For the moment, I’ve kept &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com/&quot;&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt; for icons, though eventually that will probably go as well, to be replaced with SVGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it wouldn’t be a 90s-themed website if I didn’t have a music player, so of course I had to use MIDI files. However, I quickly learned a few depressing facts: 1) modern web browsers do not support MIDI files and 2) no one just keeps webpages of free midis anymore. I had to go digging through the depths of the internet to find a few suitable tracks. I then found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-midi-player&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;web-midi-player&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package, itself built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/timidity&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timidity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, this was a mistake, as I also have to load patch files for every instrument the player will use; in the end, the downloads here are larger than if I’d just used MP3s. Furthermore, the audio driver used is not supported by most mobile browsers, so folks on their phone cannot enjoy my fine musical selections. At some point in the future, I’ll replace these with recorded MP3s of the MIDI files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a MIDI player won’t be very effective if the song stops playing when someone changes pages, so I considered using a pop-out player, but that seemed like it could be less-fun and more-annoying. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://unpoly.com/&quot;&gt;unpoly&lt;/a&gt; – a little Javascript addition that turns static websites into single-page apps by loading just particular chunks of pages into the current page. (If you work with Rails, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hotwired.dev/&quot;&gt;hotwire&lt;/a&gt; works similarly.) This way, I can swap out the main content area and leave the rest of the page alone - just like the early days of “DHTML.” One gotcha here is that for unpoly to work with your browser history (the dreaded back button problem), you have to manually set a configuration to tell it where to load it with a line of Javascript after loading, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;up.history.config.restoreTargets=[':main'];&lt;/code&gt; does the trick here. I’m surprised this isn’t the default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I sprinkled in a few easter eggs that only the most dedicated spelunkers would find. Of course, it’s not the web if it’s not weird!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do need to go back and spend some time cleaning up a few accessibility issues. I’d also like to add a classic-style links page in the future as well, but few folks are keeping their websites active these days. Maybe if this movement grows that will change!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I’m finishing work on my new t-shirt store, but following that I’ll be spending some time on a little RSS reader I’ve been tinkering with. Hopefully some of you folks will get in touch about collaborating on some of these upcoming projects - I’m looking forward to hearing from you all!&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Federal Budget Challenges</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/03/15/federal-budget-challenges/" />

  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/03/15/federal-budget-challenges/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just a reminder that this is my personal account and these are my personal thoughts that I’m posting on my personal time. I do not speak for my current or previous government agencies here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After six months of delay, Congress just passed the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR2471SA-RCP-117-35.pdf&quot;&gt;federal appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2022&lt;/a&gt; (which we are halfway through currently). I just saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jmillerWFED&quot;&gt;Jason Miller&lt;/a&gt;’s article for Federal News Network &lt;a href=&quot;https://federalnewsnetwork.com/reporters-notebook-jason-miller/2022/03/in-a-reversal-of-roles-congress-tells-the-tmf-to-show-me-the-money/&quot;&gt;pointing out that the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) had it’s budget completely cut this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmf.cio.gov/&quot;&gt;TMF&lt;/a&gt; is a much-needed band-aid on top of a massive problem, providing a source of multi-year funds for agencies that want to improve legacy systems but don’t have the money in their budget. However, alone it won’t be able to stop the bleeding - here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-annual-appropriations&quot;&gt;1. Annual Appropriations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons government IT is bad is that it’s chronically underfunded and also not funded &lt;em&gt;in the right way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally money is only appropriated for an agency to use withing a single year. They have to spend it in that time or it goes back to Treasury. This is why agencies buy printers, hardward, etc. at the end of the year, to show they used it all. Obviously, most IT projects can’t be completed in a single year. This means that there is a significant risk to starting a major IT improvement or system overhaul if the money might evaporate next year. (Or if Congress decides to delay on passing the appropriations bill for six months, preventing any additional money from being spent!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the TMF, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2227/text&quot;&gt;MGT Act&lt;/a&gt; created IT Working Capital Funds for the 24 CFO Act agencies (if they didn’t have one), which cost savings from IT projects can be funneled into, giving them a 3-year window to use saved money. This is capped at only a couple million dollars for each agency, usually about 3% of total salaries and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If I recall correctly, only the Department of Labor can sweep unused funding at the end of the year into their IT Working Capital Fund though. Also, of course, non-CFO Act agencies - all of the “smalls” - don’t usually have an IT WCF at all!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this makes major improvements almost impossible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-524t&quot;&gt;GAO has a series of reports on the needed improvements&lt;/a&gt; - but it barely scratches the surface of the problem, highlighting only 10 systems out of &lt;strong&gt;THOUSANDS&lt;/strong&gt;. And it doesn’t even cover the most important ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-competing-spending-priorities&quot;&gt;2. Competing Spending Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three big categories of spending in a government agency typically are: A. Rent; B. Salaries; C. Technology. After the first two get paid, IT finally gets a cut at what’s left. Note that the current “return to work” is a push to fill empty offices to justify constantly-increasing Rent. Salaries haven’t kept up with inflation, but still aren’t going down. That leaves only IT to keep taking a cut because some people want full offices to justify renting the space, instead of downsizing and maximizing remote/telework. (VA &amp;amp; GSA are big exceptions, which have embraced remote and closed offices!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2022/03/tobefair.jpg&quot;&gt;To be fair&lt;/a&gt;, there have been some efforts to get IT higher up the priority list for agencies, notably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1232/text&quot;&gt;FITARA&lt;/a&gt;. However, FITARA doesn’t force agencies to actually modernize, and moreover FITARA only applies to the CFO Act agencies (notice a pattern yet?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Budget side of The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is somewhat isolated from the Management side (&amp;amp; IT policy), so priorities don’t always translate. E.g., the main methodology for tracking IT spending &amp;amp; investment is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FY22ITBudget_CapitalPlanningGuidance.pdf&quot;&gt;IT Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)&lt;/a&gt; process, which is mostly not connected to the Federal Budget process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, priorities even within the Management side aren’t necessarily coordinated. Although CPIC has risk and performance management elements, it mostly isn’t attached to any of the other ongoing priorities; just look at the latest Executive Orders on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/&quot;&gt;Customer Experience&lt;/a&gt; - no mention of CPIC, and little-to-no funding for these mandates. Even though it seems obvious that work to improve security or satisfaction with services should be tied to funding measures, there are instead lots of silos and political territories sliced up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-disconnected-processes&quot;&gt;3. Disconnected Processes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget process itself is a weird game of chicken between various elected, political, and career officials. CIOs &amp;amp; CFOs know the tech debt gap, Department Secretaries/Administrators know the costs, but may not feel comfortable putting forth an accurate budget request. And when an Administration decides it wants to make reductions for, say, political reasons, IT generally is the first place to get cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then of course, Congress passes whatever budget it wants, ignoring what the President asks for. &lt;a href=&quot;https://progress.institute/preventing-pandemics-requires-funding/&quot;&gt;(Here’s a non-IT example that’s incredibly frustrating.)&lt;/a&gt; There are some really solid members that know their stuff, but most of them are clueless on tech. So when it comes to appropriations, it’s a bit like asking your grandma for that hot new Nintendo game and she buys you this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2022/03/electronic-soccer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tiger Handheld Electronic Soccer Game from the 80s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And I’m not going to get into the toxic “outsource everything tech” lobotomization of government staff issue in this rant. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/12/19/federal-policy-recs/&quot;&gt;That’s for another day.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all to say that it’s a big house of cards built on a series of broken processes. Although IT spending has increased steadily year after year, it’s still not enough to keep up with even basic upkeep of key systems. I expect we’ll see more and more high-profile failures and exploits in the near future as a result of these gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do want to say that there are lots of good folks working to make incremental progress, but we won’t see any major revolutions in how services are provided by the government until Congress &amp;amp; the President agree to truly stop the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/02/28/cloudbusting/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I discussed many of the myths around cloud use in government. In this article, I will describe critical strategies to address these myths that every organization should embrace before, during, and after moving to the cloud. These strategies are generally intended for civilian Federal agencies of the United States, but the recommendations below apply to any public sector organization - and even some private organizations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both guides are available to download as &lt;a href=&quot;/uploads/2021/03/CloudGuide.pdf&quot;&gt;a single PDF &lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-cloud-download-alt fa-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1---migrate-pragmatically&quot;&gt;Chapter 1 - Migrate Pragmatically&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to accept is that not all projects are appropriate for the cloud, and not all organizations have the skills necessary to fully take advantage of the cloud. With that as a starting point, an organization needs to come up with a way to rationalize its application portfolio, to determine what should stay on-premises and what should be modernized.  As a general rule, “lift-and-shift” - moving an application without rewriting it for the cloud environment - is &lt;em&gt;almost never cost-effective&lt;/em&gt; for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings unless it’s already a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; modern system in the first place. On the other hand, basic websites with mostly static content are ideal for moving into Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIO Council’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Application-Rationalization-Playbook.pdf&quot;&gt;Application Rationalization Playbook&lt;/a&gt; (disclaimer: another document I worked on) is a useful starting point for this evaluation. Specifically, an agency should work up a thorough analysis of alternatives between various SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS offerings against the existing on-prem setup, or a hybrid environment. A major consideration here will be the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which should take into account not just service costs, but also staffing, support, and training costs. However, the lowest priced option may not always be the best choice (as I’ll be covering below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.gov/&quot;&gt;Cloud.gov&lt;/a&gt;, is an offering from the General Services Administration (GSA) that bundles several Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings in a government-friendly “procurement wrapper” can make migration even easier for agencies. It’s an excellent platform for small agencies, or for large agencies that just want to prototype a new concept quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do start moving applications, it’s important to start tagging your assets - accounts, virtual machines, workflows, etc. - as early as possible to make accounting easier. Always include the project name and the customer organization at a minimum. Some providers also allow you to easily isolate a project or office’s services into a resource group, and this can also simplify this process. This is very important to allow easy payback or showback of funds, but for these models remember to include in these costs the TCO aspects not captured - e.g. staff time and contractor resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend agencies take a very &lt;em&gt;cynical&lt;/em&gt; stance on so-called low-code/no-code platforms, customer-relationship management tools (CRMs), and workflow management solutions. Many of you may remember the promises of “Business Intelligence” solutions in decades past, where agencies were fleeced for billions of dollars in configuration costs - these solutions are simply using a new buzzword for the same idea. These all promise to reduce costs but are often vastly more expensive than just building a tool from scratch - and the agency becomes &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; locked-in to a single vendor until they replace the application entirely. The brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sboots&quot;&gt;Sean Boots&lt;/a&gt; of the Canadian Digital Service has presented a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sboots.ca/2020/09/16/fake-cots-and-the-one-day-rule/&quot;&gt;“1-day rule” to help identify these boondoggles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-2---plan-to-your-budget--staff&quot;&gt;Chapter 2 - Plan to Your Budget &amp;amp; Staff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to avoid risks and unexpected costs is to simplify as much as possible. Civilian agencies should not be investing in bleeding-edge technology solutions - they’re too risky and expensive to maintain. Instead, pick the simplest possible solution that can be supported by your staff. The average agency should be aiming to stay well behind the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle&quot;&gt;“hype curve” into the “plateau of productivity.”&lt;/a&gt; 
Since most of the complexity is hidden from the customer, SaaS and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools are less risky than PaaS and IaaS options overall (provided you follow the 1-day rule above). This goes beyond just cloud, and applies to most anything you’re &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt;. Most agencies, for instance, also should absolutely not be attempting to build a fancy React/Redux/GraphQL single-page application when a plain Wordpress or Drupal website with a few plugins will fulfill the customer’s needs. Building native mobile applications should be &lt;em&gt;completely avoided&lt;/em&gt; by most organizations as these can cost millions of dollars a year just for upkeep - instead they should build mobile-friendly, responsive websites. Any custom application or tool may not be a sustainable solution given the high complexity and cost of engineers. This also means that agencies should be simplifying their &lt;em&gt;requirements&lt;/em&gt; to the minimum necessary when comparing alternatives, not just the software itself. Avoiding “one-off” projects and special requests will save massive amounts of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, agencies must be actively investing in &lt;em&gt;their staff&lt;/em&gt;. Agencies should allocate two to three times the standard training budget for IT and technology-adjacent staff, including project managers, program managers, and acquisition professionals. Some vendors provide a limited amount complementary training, but inevitably agencies need more than these free offerings. This training should include non-IT topics as well, including diversity awareness training, accessibility, plain language writing, project management, agile development techniques, and budgeting and procurement. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/events-and-training/gsa-training-programs/training-opportunities-for-federal-employees&quot;&gt;GSA offers a variety of programs&lt;/a&gt; covering many of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must also include hands-on training - sitting through a webinar is no replacement for actual practical engineering experience. These staff need to be given the time and flexibility to practice these skills to develop them - building small test projects and trying out tools. The best teams are constantly changing and learning, so setting aside up to 10% or more of the staff’s time just for practice is not unreasonable - some &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project&quot;&gt;private sector companies set aside 20%&lt;/a&gt;. All of these investments will pay off richly for agencies. Also, make sure your staff is cross-trained and able to fill gaps as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your staff begins to understand the new cloud paradigms, it will be important to modify your existing processes to handle the agility the cloud brings. Instead of slow, end-to-end, waterfall process “monorails”, set operational parameters as “guiderails.” Your acquisition process should be modified so that cloud can be purchased like a utility. You should not need to have a Change Control Board meeting anytime someone wants to create, resize, or destroy a virtual server. Plan a cost range that the entire project will fit within and review as needs change, along with monthly or quarterly portfolio reviews to stay on top of the budget. Instead of codified “gold disk” server images maintained by your team, consider template security rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Checklist&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;No mobile apps, avoid single-page webapps&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-user-graduate&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Train and cross-train your staff&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-chess-clock&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Allocate time for personal development&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-subway&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Update processes to set guardrails instead of monorails&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-3---embrace-new-security-models&quot;&gt;Chapter 3 - Embrace New Security Models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agencies must be able to manage the security of everything they run. Going back to the previous strategy, an agency should not deploy anything it cannot manage, and that goes for security as well. This is equally true in on-premises environments, but new operating models require new security models. Both your operations and security teams will need to be familiar with just about every setting that can be changed in your cloud environment - and how to lock them down to prevent exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations should no longer assume that a solution is secure just because they did an up-front initial review. The Federal government uses a security review process for services and applications known as the Authorization (or Authority) To Operate (ATO), but the implementation varies from agency to agency. Traditionally this is a series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53&quot;&gt;standard security controls&lt;/a&gt; that are reviewed, checklist-style, by an agency once every three years. However, agencies that have excelled at cloud security have moved to Continuous Authorization, using monitoring tools to actively verify that the security controls are being met and maintained, twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these monitoring checks still must evolve with the products being monitored to make sure new vulnerabilities have not appeared outside the scope of existing checks. As per usual with cybersecurity, vigilance is key. Since attackers are constantly evolving their methods, tools that &lt;em&gt;automate security responses&lt;/em&gt; as well should be used whenever practical - especially built-in, native from the large vendors that are constantly evolving to meet these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help combat this second issue, the Federal government has been moving away from so-called “castle-and-moat” perimeter-based security methods which only monitor network traffic. Instead, an approach known as Zero Trust has appeared, taking a data-first methodology of protecting systems instead of &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the perimeter, verifying user identities in real-time, and allowing staff to only have access to the minimum amount of information necessary to fulfill the task at hand. In this way, when the perimeter is &lt;em&gt;inevitably&lt;/em&gt; breached, the data assets contained within are still secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also should go without saying that teams should be using multi-factor authentication on all privileged accounts. Whether developers or administrators, using more than just a username and password will dramatically reduce the risk of exploitation. The Federal government has “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedidcard.gov/&quot;&gt;PIV cards&lt;/a&gt;” that are generally used on most devices, but if the vendor does not support them, implementing a token system via any of the commercially-available platforms is fine: Google Authenticator, 1Password, Microsoft Authenticator, and YubiKey are all worth looking at. However, organizations should completely avoid text-message codes sent to phones, as these are easily intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public customers that will need to login or prove their identies, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/02/18/login-gov-for-everyone/&quot;&gt;all U.S. government agencies should be using Login.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Checklist&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-toggle-on&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Research all product configuration settings&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-binoculars&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Implement continuous monitoring, not just compliance&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-cogs&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Use security automation tools&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-fingerprint&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Leverage zero-trust practices to protect your data&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-id-badge&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Use MFA &amp;amp; Login.gov&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-4---understand-what-youre-buying&quot;&gt;Chapter 4 - Understand What You’re Buying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud isn’t going to make your teeth whiter or your breath fresher or fix all of your problems, regardless of what the salespeople tell you. You need to know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you’re buying. Before making an investment, make sure you fully understand what capabilities you’re purchasing and what parts you - and the vendor - will be responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your evaluation team does not have technical expertise, bring engineers into the conversation early, to sort the truth from the sales pitch. As discussed in the previous article, you may not be getting autoscaling or load balancing or other features you’ve assumed just happen “automatically” - and if available these features definitely will not be free. You may have to build more “glue” between services than you assume, and someone will have to maintain this connective tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that the government cloud regions (or “govcloud” by some vendors’ naming) provide different versions of these tools than the commercial ones. As a result, not all features or solutions will be available - so again, plan ahead. Though, in most cases, civilian agencies not dealing with highly-sensitive data should consider using the commercial versions whenever possible - the security differences are not so great as to be insurmountable, but the functionality limitations are huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before implementing a service, do careful research on the service limits - maximum traffic or number of virtual machines or emails that can be sent, etc.. Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just trust what you are told by a vendor’s engineers or customer representatives - most of the time, they also do not know about these limits until you run aground on them. You should estimate your expected usage - number of site visits and/or users and/or emails, etc., and actually spend the time to search through user forums to make sure no one has hit a limit related to what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer Experience (CX) is another area where the private sector has been building people-friendly interfaces into their SaaS solutions, and agencies can skip a lot of the hard work and directly benefit from the results. Metrics and feedback-loops are often built-in as well. Maximizing these built-in elements can radically improve an agency’s public satisfaction scores at little or no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Checklist&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-door-open&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Consider commercial cloud instead of govcloud&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-unicorn&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Research service limits in advance&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;far fa-comment-alt-smile&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Leverage built-in CX tools&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-5---build-a-family-farm&quot;&gt;Chapter 5 - Build a Family Farm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that agency IT budgets continue to be cut, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/hist16z1_fy21.xlsx&quot;&gt;staffing has not increased in 40 years&lt;/a&gt;, agencies are largely unprepared to completely rewrite and replace all of their legacy systems.  Moreover, “IT Modernization” as a concept is an unending pursuit, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%2527s_paradoxes%23Achilles_and_the_tortoise&quot;&gt;Zeno’s paradox of Achilles chasing the Tortoise,&lt;/a&gt; software written today is legacy tomorrow. Agencies will need to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2227/text&quot;&gt;all available funding sources&lt;/a&gt; to overcome their deep technical debt, prioritizing those that present the &lt;em&gt;greatest risk&lt;/em&gt;: those that are unmaintained, frequently used by customers, and lacking in resilience and redundancy. Under this scrutiny, agencies may find that their public websites are a bigger risk than older backend systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, rather than replacing entire large monolithic systems, they should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/product/strangler-pattern-migrate-to-microservices-from-a-monolithic-app/&quot;&gt;pull off pieces and replace them independently&lt;/a&gt; as resources are available.  This can be done by isolating functions and building &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices&quot;&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt;, but that approach can often lead to expensive, unnecessary complexity. Agencies should not be afraid to build a newer parallel monolith adjacent to the existing one - again, keep in mind that it’s not the size that’s the concern, but the complexity and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all being said, the government does have major shortcomings in redundancy today, and too many systems have a single point of failure. At a minimum, agencies should be using cloud for data backup of critical systems whenever possible. I also strongly recommend agencies consider creating load balancing and caching layers in the cloud in front of on-premise public-facing systems to deal with unexpected loads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final concern is automation. Many organizations begin their cloud journey with unrealistic goals for maturity. The practice of Infrastructure as Code is incredibly popular at the moment, where we talk about treating virtual servers as “cattle, not pets.” An unprepared agency may immediately think that they need to be using all of the most cutting edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; at first, but this would be a critical mistake. Instead, following the principles relating to complexity in the sections above, agencies should aim to create a “family farm” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ICzo5r-7vY&quot;&gt;only automating that which they can realistically manage&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, there is absolutely nothing wrong with only using a few virtual machines and load balancers instead of a fully configuration-only architecture. The great thing about cloud is you can evolve as your team grows, but it’s incredibly difficult to reduce complexity you’ve invested in if your team shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;epilogue---getting-more-help&quot;&gt;Epilogue - Getting More Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These strategies are a starting point towards a successful cloud rollout. If you run into trouble, want to talk shop with your peers, or would like to share your own strategies and experiences, there are several communities to engage with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal CIO Council &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital.gov/communities/cloud-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;Cloud and Infrastructure Community of Practice&lt;/a&gt; is the main Federal group for discussing these topics. However, they are currently in the process of changing their charter to allow any U.S. government staff to participate: Federal, state, and local. Membership is free.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ATARC &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarc.org/working-groups/cloud-working-group/&quot;&gt;Cloud and Infrastructure Working Group&lt;/a&gt; is free and open to any government staff, though private sector companies must pay to be members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atarc.org/event/cloud-coffee/&quot;&gt;Cloud &amp;amp; Coffee&lt;/a&gt; (presented by ATARC &amp;amp; MorphWorks) is a biweekly podcast hosted by myself and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-oglesby-94234112/&quot;&gt;Chris Oglesby&lt;/a&gt;. Each episode, we chat with a guest about their personal experience with technology modernization, and there’s a live Q&amp;amp;A open during the chat. Any ATARC member can participate; old episodes are &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/6AU2VxO4j7dtDls4ouxdIq?si=YwhQcD7XRGWvxSQJKRmmbw&quot;&gt;publicly available on Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-broom secret-button&quot; title=&quot;ITS A SECRET TO EVERYBODY&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Cloudbuster” was a device invented by William Reich to create clouds and rain by shooting “energy” into the sky through a series of metal rods. Although Reich was paid by many desperate farmers to produce rain, the device was never proven to work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been ten years since the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/federal-cloud-computing-strategy.pdf&quot;&gt;Federal Cloud Computing Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. I had the opportunity to update this strategy two years ago when I served as the Cloud Policy Lead at OMB. Having spent 20 years in the private sector building bleeding-edge cloud infrastructure for some of the best known companies in the world, I was able to leverage my practical experience in the creation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/&quot;&gt;2019 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, “Cloud Smart”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the course of my work at OMB, I spoke with hundreds of practitioners, policy experts, and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) across government. From this vantage point, I had an intimate view into the entire Federal technology portfolio and learned that many myths about cloud computing were being accepted as truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I’ll debunk key myths about cloud adoption, and explain why - and when - cloud is appropriate for government. These myths are generally intended for civilian Federal agencies of the United States, but the recommendations below apply to any public sector organization - and even some private organizations as well. In &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/03/07/cloud-strategy-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;part two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll discuss some strategies for overcoming the pitfalls discussed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both guides are available to download as &lt;a href=&quot;/uploads/2021/03/CloudGuide.pdf&quot;&gt;a single PDF &lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-cloud-download-alt fa-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myth-1-cloud-is-cheaper&quot;&gt;Myth 1: Cloud Is Cheaper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason cited by Federal agencies to move to commercial cloud is the promise of cost savings. This myth originated with vendors and was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1232/text&quot;&gt;repeated by Congress&lt;/a&gt;, eventually becoming a common talking point for Executive Branch agencies. Unfortunately, it is based on false premises and poor cost analyses. In practice, the government almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; saves actual money moving to the cloud - though the capabilities they gain from that investment will usually result in a greater &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it can appear that moving applications to the cloud may be cheaper than leaving them in a data center. But in most cases, a Federal agency will not see much, if any, cost savings from moving to the cloud. More often than not, they end up spending many times more on cloud than for comparable workloads run in their data center. Experts have &lt;a href=&quot;https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/when-cloud-computing-doesnt-make-sense/&quot;&gt;known this was a myth for at least a decade&lt;/a&gt;, but the lobbyists and salespeople were simply louder than those who had done the math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it’s important to note that most Federal agencies own outright the facilities their data centers are located in. In the 1980s and 1990s, agencies began repurposing existing office space for use as data centers, adding in advanced cooling and electrical systems to support their growing compute needs. This changes the equation for the total cost of ownership because the facilities are already built and can be run &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; cheaply, though they may be partially or fully staffed by contractors due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/19/federal-policy-recs/&quot;&gt;constant push to outsource all work&lt;/a&gt;. The government has also built a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; best-in-breed data centers such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/09/30/new-social-security-data-center-comes-online-in-maryland&quot;&gt;Social Security Administration’s flagship data center&lt;/a&gt; that can compete with some of the most efficient commercial facilities in the world, with solar collectors for electricity generation, and advanced heat management systems for reduced energy usage. However, these super-efficient facilities are only represent a handful of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itdashboard.gov/drupal/data-center-statistics&quot;&gt;over 1500 data centers the government owns and operates&lt;/a&gt;, and cost half a billion dollars each to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, agencies routinely run their servers and equipment well past the end-of-life to save money. There are no Federal requirements to update hardware. In fact, until recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_19_1.pdf&quot;&gt;Federal data center requirements for efficiency&lt;/a&gt; measured the utilization of servers by time spent processing, which &lt;em&gt;disincentivized&lt;/em&gt; agencies from upgrading - older hardware runs slower and thus results in a higher &lt;em&gt;utilization&lt;/em&gt; rate for a given task than a newer, more efficient server that completes the task quickly. During a budget shortfall, an agency with a data center has the option of skipping a hardware refresh cycle or cutting staff to make up the deficit; meanwhile, an agency that is all-in on cloud loses this option, as they will have to continue paying for licenses, operations and maintenance costs. As a result, agencies will need to future-proof their plans in more innovative ways, or better communicate funding priorities to OMB and Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s important to realize that once the government does buy hardware, the government owns it outright. When you move your application to a commercial cloud, you’re paying a premium for data storage even if it’s just sitting around and not being actively used - for large amounts of data, cloud costs will quickly skyrocket. The government maintains &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt; worth of massive data sets - NASA generates &lt;em&gt;terabytes&lt;/em&gt; of data per day, and even a tiny agency like the Small Business Administration has to maintain &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of scanned loan documents going back to its inception sixty years ago. This is why some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekwire.com/2018/dropbox-saved-almost-75-million-two-years-building-tech-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;major companies have moved away from commercial cloud and built their own infrastructure instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would note that the idea of workload portability  - moving a service between different cloud vendors, generally to get a cheaper cost - is also largely a myth. The cost to move between services is simply too great, and the time spent in building this flexibility will not realize any savings. Moreover, every cloud vendor’s offering is just &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; different from its peers, and if you’re only using the most basic offerings which are  identical - virtual servers and storage - you’re missing out on the full value that cloud offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myth-2-cloud-requires-fewer-staff&quot;&gt;Myth 2: Cloud Requires Fewer Staff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another promise of cloud cost savings is that an agency no longer has to keep data center engineers on staff. These practitioners are usually comparatively cheap to employ in government, and rarely reach a grade above GS-13 ($76K-$99K annual salary) and agencies moving to cloud will instead employ comparatively expensive DevSecOps practitioners, site reliability engineers, and cloud-software engineers to replace them when moving applications to IaaS or PaaS. These types of staff are extremely difficult to hire into government as they make very high salaries in the private sector, well in excess of the highest end of the General Schedule pay scale (GS-15: $104K-138K), even assuming an agency has the budget and staff slots open to create a GS-15 position in the first place. Due to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/19/federal-policy-recs/&quot;&gt;many flaws in the government hiring process&lt;/a&gt;, it also can be very difficult to recruit these people into government, even with the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/news/releases/2019/04/opm-releases-new-direct-hire-process-for-it-positions/&quot;&gt;OPM hiring authorities&lt;/a&gt; to streamline this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agency that chooses to outsource these skills will often find that contractors may cost even more than hiring capable staff. The agency will still need to have staff with cloud experience to actively manage these staff, and contracts will need to be carefully crafted around concrete outcomes so that the agency is not fleeced by a vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another overlooked cost here is training. New solutions aren’t always easy for agencies to adopt - whether that’s a fancy software development tool or something as simple as a video chat platform. Personally, a day doesn’t go by that I don’t find myself explaining to a customer some aspect of Teams or Sharepoint they don’t know how to use. Agencies often must provide formal training, and of course there’s inevitably a loss of productivity while teams get up to speed on the new tools and solutions. Since many SaaS vendors roll out new features extremely rapidly, this can present a challenge for slow-to-adapt agencies. Although some training is provided free from vendors, this rarely suffices for all of an agency’s needs, so in most cases further training will have to be purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myth-3-cloud-is-more-secure&quot;&gt;Myth 3: Cloud Is More Secure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant refrain is that cloud is safer and more secure, owing to the fact that the servers are patched automatically - meaning that key security updates are installed immediately, rather than waiting for a human to make the time to roll out all of these updates.  For a large enterprise, this is historically a very time-consuming manual process, which automation has improved dramatically. However, the same tools that major corporations use for patching in the Cloud are largely open source and free, and they can be used in an agency’s own data center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it’s important to note that cloud does not remove complexity, it only hides it in places that are harder to see.  When it comes to security, this is especially true, as organizations must adapt to highly-specialized security settings that are not always easily found, particularly with the IaaS offerings. These settings are also constantly changing because of the constant-patching of these vendors, and all too often with little notice in the case of SaaS offerings. This “double-edged sword” has resulted in a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/capital-one-data-breach-a-cloud-security-case-study-7a06e00460&quot;&gt;high-profile cloud-related breaches&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years - affecting both the public and private sectors alike as we learn best security practices the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud vendors have also been… less than enthusiastic about meeting government security and policy requirements, unless the government is willing to pay a very high premium for the privilege of security. (I talked about this contentious relationship more in my post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/21/ai-ml-rpa-principles/&quot;&gt;Automation Principles&lt;/a&gt;.) For instance, as of today no major cloud vendor completely meets the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/M-21-07.pdf&quot;&gt;government requirements for IPv6&lt;/a&gt; which have been around for 15 years and which OMB recently revised to try to get them to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myth-4-cloud-is-more-reliable&quot;&gt;Myth 4: Cloud Is More Reliable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is less of a myth and more of an overpromise, or fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying technology. For a long time, one of the main pitches of cloud is that of self-healing infrastructure - when one server or drive fails, a new one is spun up to replace it. Although this is something that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be implemented in the cloud, it’s definitely not the default. Specifically, for IaaS solutions, you have to build that into your application - and you don’t get it for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, many agencies assume that any application put into the cloud will automatically scale to meet any demand. If your agency’s website gets mentioned by the President, let’s say, you wouldn’t want it to collapse due to its newfound popularity. Without building infrastructure designed to handle this, simply being “in the cloud” will not solve this problem. However, solving it in the cloud will likely be faster than waiting for physical servers to be purchased, built, shipped, and installed - assuming you have staff on-hand who can handle the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind cloud is, by definition, &lt;em&gt;ephemeral&lt;/em&gt;. Servers and drives are often replaced with little-to-no notice. I’ve frequently had virtual machines simply become completely unresponsive, requiring them to be rebooted or rebuilt entirely. When you’re building in the cloud, you should assume that anything could break without warning, and you should have recovery procedures in place to handle the situation. Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/&quot;&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt; can help you test your recovery procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue that some of the most seasoned practitioners often miss is that all cloud providers have hard limits on their resources that they are able to sell you. After all, they are just running their own data centers, and there are a fixed number of servers that they have on-hand. I have often encountered these limits in practical, seemingly-simple use cases. For instance, I’ve created applications which needed high-memory virtual servers, where the provider didn’t have enough instances to sell us. During the pandemic response, I also discovered that cloud-based email inboxes have &lt;em&gt;hardcoded, technical limits&lt;/em&gt; as to the volume of mail they can receive. I had assumed we could simply buy more capacity but this was not the case, requiring a “Rube Goldberg machine” workaround of routing rules to handle the massive increase associated with a national disaster. There is no question that scalability is a huge benefit, &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; the practical limits become a &lt;em&gt;liability&lt;/em&gt; because of your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;myth-5-cloud-must-be-all-or-nothing&quot;&gt;Myth 5: Cloud Must Be All-or-Nothing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizations assume that the goal is to move everything to a commercial cloud provider.  Both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2017/03/gao-optimize-data-centers-or-lose-them/136416/&quot;&gt;Government Accountability Office and Congress&lt;/a&gt; have stated that the government needs to “get out of the data center business.” However, this is simply not a realistic goal in the public sector - government couldn’t afford to make such a massive move given their very restricted budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also must clarify the concept of “legacy systems,” another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/677454.pdf&quot;&gt;frequent talking point&lt;/a&gt;. Most Federal agencies that have been around for more than 30 years still have mainframes, and they’re often still running older programming languages such as COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal. Many major industries in the private sector still use these &lt;em&gt;same technologies&lt;/em&gt; - most notably, the banking industry still is heavily dependent on these legacy systems. Regardless of the hype about cloud and blockchain for moving money around, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/cobol-controls-your-money&quot;&gt;95% of credit card transactions still use a COBOL system&lt;/a&gt;, probably running on a mainframe behind the scenes. These systems are not going away &lt;em&gt;any time soon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now these mainframes usually are not dusty old metal boxes that have been taking up an entire basement room for decades. Often, they’re cutting edge hardware that’s incredibly efficient - and even have all the shiny plastic and glowing lights and advanced cooling systems you’d expect to see on a gamer’s desktop computer. Dollar for dollar, modern mainframe systems can be more cost-effective than cloud for comparable workloads over their lifecycle. It’s also worth noting that they are about a thousand times &lt;em&gt;less likely&lt;/em&gt; to be attacked or exploited than cloud-based infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code running on these mainframes, on the other hand, is likely to be &lt;em&gt;very old&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s almost certainly been written such that it cannot be virtualized or moved to the cloud without rewriting partially or entirely at great expense. Modern programming languages &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/&quot;&gt;come with their own risks&lt;/a&gt;, so finding a &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt; middle path between the ancient and bleeding-edge is important for a successful modernization effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the considerations above, the future of government infrastructure will remain a hybrid, multi-cloud environment - much to the consternation of cloud vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-i-just-know-that-something-good-is-gonna-happen&quot;&gt;“… I just know that something good is gonna happen”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of these myths, the best reason to use cloud is for the unrivaled &lt;em&gt;capabilities&lt;/em&gt; that these tools can unlock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agility: being able to quickly spin up a server to try something new is much easier in the cloud, if you have not already created an on-premise virtualized infrastructure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.gov/&quot;&gt;Cloud.gov&lt;/a&gt;, an offering from the General Services Administration (GSA) that bundles many Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings in a government-friendly “procurement wrapper” can make this even easier for agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scalability: the main hallmark of cloud is using this agility to quickly respond to sudden increases in requests to websites and applications. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, agencies have taken advantage of this functionality to deal with the dramatic increase in traffic to benefit applications and other services. However, it is critical to note that most cloud services do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; scale automatically (another myth covered below).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distributed: most Federal agencies have staff in field offices all over the country, and of course their customers are both at home and abroad. Since the cloud is really just a series of distributed data centers around the world, this can dramatically reduce the latency between the customer and the service. For instance, agencies are using cloud-based virtual private network (VPN) solutions to securely connect their staff to internal networks. Those that have moved to cloud-based email, video chat, and document collaboration tools see an additional speed bump for staying in the same cloud for all of these services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all know that “cloud is just someone else’s data center,” but the government should not be held back by fear, uncertainty, and doubt from someone else holding their data. Cloud technologies have a huge potential to improve Federal technology, when approached with a full knowledge of the complexity and costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud is not a replacement for good management, however. &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/19/federal-policy-recs/&quot;&gt;You can’t buy your way out of risk&lt;/a&gt;. Until the government invests in its workforce to make sure that IT can be planned, acquired, implemented, and maintained effectively, we will not see any improvement in the services provided to the American people. Now, Congress just needs to be convinced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/&quot;&gt;fully fund some of these improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I’ll share &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/03/07/cloud-strategy-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;part two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I will discuss several key strategies for a successful cloud implementation in a government agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  <updated>2021-02-19T04:48:24+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2021/02/18/login-gov-for-everyone/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;A little over two years ago, I was walking out of the New Executive Office Building by the White House. I immediately ran into &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RobinCarnahan&quot;&gt;Robin Carnahan&lt;/a&gt;, who said to me, “Bill, we should be able to provide Login to cities and states.” (If you haven’t met Robin, let me just make it clear for the narrative here that she’s super-smart and anything she says you should just agree with immediately because she knows what she’s talking about.) As soon as I got back to my desk at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), I started sending out emails to figure out why the General Services Administration (GSA) was preventing this excellent service from being used by smaller governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know about this hidden gem, &lt;a href=&quot;https://login.gov/&quot;&gt;Login.gov&lt;/a&gt; is a GSA solution to help solve the difficult problem of verifying that a person is who they say they are to receive a government benefit, as well as a solution for logging into government websites.  It was created through the combined efforts of USDS and 18F - the two most prominent digital service teams in all of government - and is in use by many Federal agencies today. Today it provides access to government services for over &lt;strong&gt;27 million people&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2021/02/18/logingov-to-provide-authentication-and-identity-proofing-services-to-a-limited-number-of-federally-funded-state-and-local-government-programs&quot;&gt;GSA has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Login.gov is available for use by local and state governments!  (To be clear, I had effectively nothing to do with the actual permission being granted here - sending stern emails had little effect. The victory today belongs entirely to the wonderful, amazing, fantastic team at Login and the bureaucrats who were willing to push to make it happen.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, still a few restrictions for city and state use. To be eligible, the government agencies must be using Login for a “federally funded program.” This is an arbitrary addition by GSA that, in my opinion, misinterprets the original intent of the legal authority - but I’m not a lawyer and am no longer responsible for these sorts of policy decisions. I am hopeful that this restriction will be removed in the future and this incredible service will be open to all who want it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2020/12/18/federal-policy-recs/#4-solve-identity-once-and-for-all&quot;&gt;I’ve written in the past&lt;/a&gt;, it is my hope that OMB will &lt;strong&gt;mandate&lt;/strong&gt; the use of Login for all Federal agencies. This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section1523&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;already mandated by law&lt;/a&gt;, but OMB is not enforcing the requirement. The most expensive part of the tool is the identity verification step - however, once an identity has been proven, it does not need to be re-proven if the customer wants to use any other service that is using Login. This means that as more organizations sign up for Login, the cost to each decreases. By allowing Federal agencies to maintain their own independent login systems, the costs remain high. Moreover, this presents customers with an inferior experience, as they must sign up for a new account for each website or application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that most identity verification behind the scenes is using data sources that the government controls and gives to private companies, who then sell the government back its own data in the verification process at a very high premium. Eventually, it would be smarter to allow agencies to exchange the necessary information themselves, cutting out the middleperson, which would decrease the cost to &lt;em&gt;almost nothing.&lt;/em&gt; (Congress, of course, could speed this along too with the right legislation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard that the Login team has also been working on a pilot to allow customers to prove their identity in-person at a government facility, which has shown to improve the success rates of the verification process. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses such a process to help Veterans walk through the process of setting up their online accounts right in the lobby of many VA health clinics. The US Postal Service also performed a similar pilot several years ago, where anyone could stop by a post office and have them review their documents, or even let their postal carrier perform the review when they drop off the day’s mail, allowing them to reach almost every single person in the country!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detractors still complain about the cost of Login.gov, and consider that a reason to not require it, even though the cost would be reduced if it &lt;em&gt;was mandated&lt;/em&gt;. Even so, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the Federal government agrees that this is the tool that agencies should be using, then it should be treated like a Public Good - like a library or park. To that end, Congress could pass appropriations dedicated to funding this critical program, for instance as part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/legislation/2021/01/20/president-biden-announces-american-rescue-plan/&quot;&gt;President Biden’s proposal for TTS Funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I would caution agencies from implementing identity requirements &lt;strong&gt;beyond what is absolutely necessary&lt;/strong&gt;! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/projects/special-publication-800-63&quot;&gt;Digital Identity Guidelines from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)&lt;/a&gt; are the baseline that most Federal agencies use; in my personal opinion, they set too high a bar. The government must provide critical services to at-risk and economically disadvantaged groups, and by setting requirements that individuals in these groups cannot meet agencies are not serving people equitably. For instance, the the VA serves Veterans that may be homeless, may not have a credit card, may be partially or fully blind, may have trouble remembering or recalling information, may not have fingerprints, and so on.  Since the standard methods of identity verification and authentication may present an impossible barrier for the very people the VA serves, it is in the best interest of these people to not implement NIST’s high standards as written. (And I told NIST the same thing.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a city or state government interested in a world-class identity solution, I’d recommend reaching out to GSA about Login.gov! Even if you don’t meet the requirement mentioned above, it’s definitely worthwhile to getting in touch with GSA anyway - as we’ve learned, policies change every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you may be having trouble keeping up with all the new Executive Orders and OMB Memos that the Biden Administration is putting out.  To help, I’ve created a little bot to look for changes on specific pages of the White House website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EOPbot&quot;&gt;@EOPbot&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/01/fedwifi.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2022.09.11:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve added posts from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Personnel Management to EOPbot! I’ve also added RSS Feeds for folks who don’t use Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Posts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.billhunt.dev/eopbot/feed/all.rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.billhunt.dev/eopbot/feed/all.atom.xml&quot;&gt;ATOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Memos &amp;amp; Policies Only:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.billhunt.dev/eopbot/feed/filtered.rss.xml&quot;&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.billhunt.dev/eopbot/feed/filtered.atom.xml&quot;&gt;ATOM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), I generally had the inside track on most IT policies as they were being drafted. However, I didn’t usually get to see every Executive Order (EO) or presidential action until after they were published. Now that I work for a Federal agency, it’s even harder for me to keep up with all the changes that we have to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Biden Administration has been &lt;strong&gt;busy&lt;/strong&gt;! In just his first week, President Biden has already issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/&quot;&gt;31 official actions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/memoranda/&quot;&gt;two OMB memoranda&lt;/a&gt; - that’s a lot! To help me stay on top of all of these policy changes, I went back to my civic tech roots and created a simple web scraper to monitor for changes to the White House website. Of course, it wouldn’t be civic tech if I didn’t share the resource with everyone, so I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EOPbot&quot;&gt;pushing the results to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/EOPBot&quot;&gt;released the code&lt;/a&gt; under an open source license as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since The White House website now runs on Wordpress, it does have &lt;a href=&quot;https://whitehouse.gov/feed/&quot;&gt;a limited RSS feed for its posts&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Executive Orders. However, other actions from the other Executive Office of the President (EOP) offices, such as OMB and OSTP, aren’t “posts” and are not included in that feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, a well-staffed communications team could publish these items far easier than I can scrape them, both to the website as posts as well as to official twitter feeds. I’d be happy to hand over the &lt;strong&gt;@EOPbot&lt;/strong&gt; account to an official government team to pick up this work if anyone in EOP is interested!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you find something broken, or if you’d like to contribute an improvement, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krusynth&quot;&gt;send me a tweet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krusynth/EOPBot/issues&quot;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;This article is part three in a &lt;a href=&quot;/policy-recs/&quot;&gt;series on IT policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. A PDF of the full recommendations may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2020/12/IT-Policy-Recommendations-2021-2024.pdf&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Robotic Processing Automation (RPA)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and other related predictive algorithm technologies &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/5901/text/enr&quot;&gt;continue to gain attention&lt;/a&gt;. However, at the moment their promises are far greater than the reality, and instead of successes we continue to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28&quot;&gt;the worst of ourselves reflected back&lt;/a&gt;. Vendors also continue to oversell the functionality of these tools, while glossing over major expenses and difficulties, such as acquiring and tagging training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration, rather than increasing scrutiny and oversight of these technologies, only sought to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/14/2019-02544/maintaining-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;reduce barriers to its usage&lt;/a&gt;. The Biden Administration will need to** create stronger protections for the American people through better governance of the usage of these solutions in government.**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that humans have written our biases into our processes, and automation only expedites and amplifies these biases. (The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0739MF8VF/&quot;&gt;Automating Inequality&lt;/a&gt; explains this better than I ever could.) As a technologist, I become concerned when I hear of government agencies implementing these technologies for decision-making, as our unequal systems will only lead to greater inequity. It’s all too easy to “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/only-seven-of-stanfords-first-5-000-vaccines-were-designated-for-medical-residents&quot;&gt;blame the algorithm&lt;/a&gt;” to avoid liability, but it’s who humans create the algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the Federal government cannot have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist&quot;&gt;racist chatbots&lt;/a&gt;. The government must not exacerbate the problem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/853934104/minority-owned-small-businesses-were-supposed-to-get-priority-they-may-not-have&quot;&gt;minorities not receiving benefits they deserve&lt;/a&gt;. And the government should not be using tools that can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6&quot;&gt;reenforce existing racism and sexism&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/&quot;&gt;remaining willfully ignorant of these topics&lt;/a&gt;. Yet with all of these failures, we still see organizations running gleefully towards toxic ideas such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/why-big-data-analysis-of-police-activity-is-inherently-biased-72640&quot;&gt;predictive policing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/07/defund-facial-recognition/613771/&quot;&gt;facial-recognition technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, &lt;strong&gt;this is a question of ethics.&lt;/strong&gt; Although in government we have extensive ethics laws and regulations in regard to finances and influence, there is almost no actual guidance on ethical practices in the use of technology. And in the U.S. there exists no standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring&quot;&gt;code of ethics for software engineering&lt;/a&gt;, no &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath&quot;&gt;Hippocratic Oath&lt;/a&gt; for practicing technology. However, we do have a series of regulatory proxies for ethics, in the form of security and privacy requirements aimed to protect the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/12/AI.png&quot; alt=&quot;A diagram reflecting the balance between human versus computer decision-making and impact to human life and livelihood.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagram reflecting the balance between human versus computer decision-making and impact to human life and livelihood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;requiring a series of controls&lt;/strong&gt; — not unlike those that we use for IT security — we can increase the safety of the usage of these tools. Similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final&quot;&gt;current National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) classifications for Low, Medium, and High security systems&lt;/a&gt;, artificial intelligence systems should be classified by their impact to people, and the level of automation that is allowed must be guided by the impact. And like the NIST security controls, these must be auditable and testable, to make sure systems are functioning within the expected policy parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, a robot vacuum cleaner presents very little risk of life, but can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boredpanda.com/robot-vacuum-cleaner-spreads-dog-shit-everywhere/&quot;&gt;cause some inconvenience if it misbehaves&lt;/a&gt;, so very few controls and human oversight would be required. But automation in the processing for loans or other benefits may disastrously impact people’s finances, so higher controls must be implemented and more human engagement should be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably among these controls must be &lt;strong&gt;explainability in decision-making&lt;/strong&gt; by computers. When a decision is made by a machine — for instance, the denial of a benefit to a person — we must be able to see exactly &lt;em&gt;how and why&lt;/em&gt; the decision was made and improve the system in the future. This is a requirement that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/static/documents/perspectives-on-issues-in-ai-governance.pdf&quot;&gt;megacorporations have long railed against&lt;/a&gt; due to the potential legal liabilities they may face in having to provide such documentation, but the Administration must not yield to these private interests at the expense of The People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key control will be transparency in the usage of these systems, and all Federal agencies must be required to notify the people when such a system is in use. This should be done both through a Federal Records Notice similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/privacy-act-notices-regs&quot;&gt;to the ones required for new information systems&lt;/a&gt;, but also on the form, tool, or decision letter &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; so that consumers are aware of how these tools are used. Standard, plain language descriptions should be created and used government-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to that control, any system that makes a determination, on a benefit or similar, must have a process for the recipient to appeal the decision to an actual human in a timely fashion. This requirement is &lt;em&gt;deliberately&lt;/em&gt; burdensome, as it will actively curtail many inappropriate uses in government, since overtaxed government processes won’t be able to keep up with too many denied benefits. For instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals/&quot;&gt;Veterans Benefit Appeals system&lt;/a&gt; currently is entirely manual, but has a delay of a year or more, and some Veterans have been waiting years for appeals to be adjudicated; if a system is seeing an unreasonably large number of appeals of benefit denials, that’s a good indicator of a broken system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover the result of that appeal must become part of the determining framework after re-adjudication, and any previous adjudications or pending appeals should be automatically reconsidered retroactively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also exists a category of uses of Artificial Intelligence that the government should entirely prohibit. The most extreme and obvious example is the creation of lethal robots for law enforcement or military usage — regardless of what benefits the Department of Defense and military vendors try to sell us. Although there’s little fear of a science-fiction dystopia of self-aware murderbots, major ethical considerations must still be taken into account. If we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/867532070/trumps-unannounced-church-visit-angers-church-officials&quot;&gt;cannot trust even human officers to act ethically under political duress&lt;/a&gt;, we certainly cannot expect robots devoid of any empathy to protect our citizens from tyranny when they can be turned against people with the push of a button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the government must also be able to hold private companies liable for their usage of these technologies both in government and the private sector as well. If something fails, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2521/text&quot;&gt;government legally owns the risk&lt;/a&gt;, but that does not mean that private companies should escape blame or penalties. The increase in companies creating self-driving cars will inevitably lead to more deaths, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2019/03/06/700801945/uber-not-criminally-liable-in-death-of-woman-hit-by-self-driving-car-says-prosec&quot;&gt;these companies continue to avoid any responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/AV/federal-automated-vehicles-policy-september-2016&quot;&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s recommendations on autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; do not go nearly far enough, merely making the “request that manufacturers and other entities &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt; provide reports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the government must make a stand to protect its people, instead of merely serving the interests of private companies — it cannot do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further reading, the governments of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2020-12/bkc-policy-practice-ai-hosts-expert-review-colombias-ai-ethical-framework-focus-youth&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; have released guidance on this topic, providing an excellent starting point for other governments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some of us technologists have referred to RPA as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk&quot;&gt;Steampunkification&lt;/a&gt;” instead of IT modernization, as the older systems are still left in place while newer tech is just stuck on top, increasing rather than decreasing the technical debt of an organization— much as Steampunks glue shiny gears onto old hats as fashion. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Reskilling and Hiring for Technology in Government</title>

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;This article is part two in a &lt;a href=&quot;/policy-recs/&quot;&gt;series on IT policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. A PDF of the full recommendations may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2020/12/IT-Policy-Recommendations-2021-2024.pdf&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of business is &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;/strong&gt; — we move, refine, and combine goods and services and data, which generates &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; — and this is true both in the public and the private sector. Technology is just one of the ways that we &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; that change. Those organizations that do best at managing change are often the best equipped to deal with the relentless pace of transformation within the IT field itself. Government, however, tends to resist change because of misaligned value incentives which prioritize &lt;em&gt;stability *and avoid *risk&lt;/em&gt;, though these elements do not necessarily need to be at odds with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Reagan era, government agencies have outsourced more and more IT tasks to contractors and vendors, under the false promise of reduced risk and increased savings for taxpayers. There’s an infamous joke that we’ve done such a good job of saving money through IT over the last decade that we’ve reduced the IT budget of $2 billion to $40 billion. Yet almost all of that spending has gone to private companies, instead of increasing Federal staff and providing needed training, and the government has astonishingly little positive progress to show for it —&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/highrisk/improving_management_it_acquisitions_operations/why_did_study&quot;&gt; systems and projects continue to fail&lt;/a&gt;. This effort has &lt;em&gt;lobotomized&lt;/em&gt; government by eliminating subject matter experts, reducing its ability to manage change, and as a result has greatly increased — rather than reduced — the risk for Federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agencies have tried to “buy their way out” of their risk, by leveraging vendors and IT products to “absorb” the risk. Unfortunately, government doesn’t work that way — agencies are solely responsible for risk, and if something fails, the agency, not the vendor, is the one on the hook for any lawsuits or Congressional hearings that result. &lt;strong&gt;The only practical way for agencies to deal with their risk and begin paying down the government’s massive &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt&quot;&gt;technical debt&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.gov/assets/resources/Future_of_Federal_IT_Workforce_Update_Public_Version.pdf&quot;&gt;hire and train experts&lt;/a&gt; inside of government who can address these problems directly, and begin to facilitate change management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/&quot;&gt;Cloud Smart strategy&lt;/a&gt; OMB states, “to harness new capabilities and expand existing abilities to enable their mission and deliver services to the public faster … instead of ‘buy before build’, agencies will need to move to ‘&lt;strong&gt;solve before buy&lt;/strong&gt;,’ addressing their service needs, fundamental requirements, and gaps in processes and skillsets.” Although there has been a major effort to hire and train cybersecurity professionals in government, technology literacy needs to be improved in all job roles. Technology will always be a core function of government, and to be successful, government &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have expertise in its core functions; to do otherwise is to deliberately sabotage that success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/&quot;&gt;GSA’s 18F Team&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usds.gov/&quot;&gt;The US Digital Service (USDS)&lt;/a&gt; have proven that there is a need for this expertise, and the government must continue and expand on those efforts by teaching agencies “how to fish.” Beyond just these short-term hires via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chcoc.gov/content/smarter-it-delivery-schedule-hiring-authority&quot;&gt;Digital Service/Schedule A&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/direct-hire-authority/#url=Governmentwide-Authority&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity/2210&lt;/a&gt; to augment staff temporarily, &lt;strong&gt;agencies need to invest in &lt;em&gt;permanently&lt;/em&gt; expanding their knowledge, skills, and capacity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;increase-training-opportunities-for-federal-government-employees&quot;&gt;Increase Training Opportunities for Federal Government Employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there needs to be a** governmentwide approach to increasing training&lt;strong&gt;, starting with **additional funding in the President’s budget dedicated to improving IT skills&lt;/strong&gt;. Financial and leave award incentives could also be used to encourage staff to participate in more training outside of their immediate job roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.gov/programs-and-events/reskilling/&quot;&gt;Federal Cybersecurity Reskilling Academy&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/&quot;&gt;Cloud Smart strategy&lt;/a&gt; was a good start, but didn’t go far enough. It’s impossible to fully train a practitioner in everything they need to know about Cybersecurity — or any other complex technology — in just a few short weeks. A real &lt;strong&gt;apprenticeship program&lt;/strong&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/details-transfers/&quot;&gt;agency rotation &amp;amp; detail programs&lt;/a&gt; for staff into more IT-mature agencies would have a major impact, by allowing staff to learn skills on-the-job in a hands-on way. Many of these skills are impossible to learn meaningfully from a book or seminar; in general most technical certifications — instead of being required — should be met with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all policy decisions today have some aspect of technology involved. To address the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-471&quot;&gt;rapidly aging Federal IT infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; and make smart investments with taxpayer dollars, all of our leaders need to be equipped with knowledge of modern systems beyond just the sales pitches they receive from vendors. Ongoing training in technology must be made a priority and part of every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/&quot;&gt;Senior Executive Service (SES)&lt;/a&gt; performance plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-new-it-job-series&quot;&gt;Create a new IT Job Series&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many technologists have been willing to work for a short term of 2–4 years in government at a massive pay cut just out of a feeling of civic duty, this sort of “holiday labor” is not a sustainable path for long-term success. A new Administration will need to &lt;strong&gt;address the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2020/01/report-feds-are-increasingly-interested-leaving-certain-private-sector-jobs/162461/&quot;&gt;massive pay disparity for government IT jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which acts as a barrier to both hiring and retaining staff. The White House will need to direct the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish a proper IT job series or extend the 2210 CyberSecurity role definition, and create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.opm.gov/specialrates/index.aspx&quot;&gt;special rate&lt;/a&gt; that reduces this gap particularly at the top end of the scale (GS-13 through GS-15).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally this pay should be competitive with the private sector by locale, or as close to the standard rates as possible. And this pay must be made available to staff as they are retrained, &lt;em&gt;not just&lt;/em&gt; to outsiders coming in to government with lucrative salaries from the private sector. Without this key step, the work done to reskill our staff will be lost as they use their new skills to find better-paying employment outside of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, this job series should include not only security personnel, software engineers, and graphic designers, but also non-traditional (but very important) members of government technical teams such as program &amp;amp; product managers, contracting officer representatives (CORs), customer experience experts, and content designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;leverage-modern-hiring-techniques-to-bring-in-skilled-personnel&quot;&gt;Leverage Modern Hiring Techniques to Bring in Skilled Personnel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, agencies must be directed to &lt;strong&gt;aggressively move away from older hiring processes and switch to techniques which evaluate if candidates can actually do the job&lt;/strong&gt;. OPM, in coordination with USDS, has already done a lot of work towards this, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chcoc.gov/content/draft-general-schedule-qualifications-policy-eo-13932-modernizing-and-reforming-assessment-0&quot;&gt;eliminating education requirements&lt;/a&gt; and moving to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govloop.com/usds-opm-test-new-ideas-for-improving-hiring-outcomes/&quot;&gt;knowledge-based hiring techniques&lt;/a&gt;, but agencies largely have not yet implemented this new guidance. The White House will need to apply more pressure for these changes if agencies are expected to adopt them. Initiatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.f6s.com/launchgrad&quot;&gt;Launch Grad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship&quot;&gt;Civic Digital Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; could also provide a pipeline for potential candidates with critical skills into government service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-diversity-in-the-senior-executive-service&quot;&gt;Improving Diversity in the Senior Executive Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, major improvements must be made to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/&quot;&gt;Senior Executive Service&lt;/a&gt; (SES) hiring process. These staff represent the senior leaders at Federal agencies, and almost all policy decisions today have some aspect of technology involved. To address the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-471&quot;&gt;rapidly aging Federal IT infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; and make smart investments with taxpayer dollars, all of our leaders need to be equipped with knowledge of modern systems beyond just the sales pitches they receive from vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing critical technical knowledge of these key decision-makers, the lack of diversity of this group has gone woefully unaddressed even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-04-123T&quot;&gt;after years of critical reports&lt;/a&gt;. Since these SESs are on the boards that hire the other SESs, and many of these leadership roles are filled due to tacit political connections not the candidates’ skills, it is unlikely that the diversity will improve organically from this in-group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire hiring process needs to be reconsidered to level the playing field. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/executive-core-qualifications/&quot;&gt;Executive Core Qualifications&lt;/a&gt; (ECQs) were a good idea to set a baseline for expertise in senior management, but have largely become an expensive gatekeeping exercise. This has given rise to a cottage industry of writers who simply churn out government resumes to a pricetag of &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of dollars. I know of very few SES staff who were not either hand-picked for their first SES role or who paid to have their resume written by a professional. This limits these staff to those who can “pay to play” — either with literal dollars or political influence, severely limiting the candidate pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the reviewer’s end, it’s long been known that overtaxed human resources staff are often just &lt;a href=&quot;https://ask.fedweek.com/writing-senior-executive-service-ses-resume/&quot;&gt;searching for keywords from the job postings&lt;/a&gt; in the resumes as a means of first review, which eliminates anyone who may have missed a &lt;em&gt;specific word or phrase&lt;/em&gt;. Government expertise and education &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be given a higher standing than outside experience as well. And after your ECQs have been approved once you don’t need to have them re-reviewed for each job, further narrowing the list of candidates who are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single, easy solution to the systemic problems in this process. Expanding training opportunities for senior General Schedule employees (GS-14 and GS-15) beyond just the outdated and time-consuming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/candidate-development-programs/&quot;&gt;Candidate Development Program&lt;/a&gt; would be a first step. A new Administration could make diversity a key priority in the President’s Management Agenda, setting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2011/09/22/10251/a-better-more-diverse-senior-executive-service-in-2050/&quot;&gt;goals for hiring and new initiatives for recruiting&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chcoc.gov/&quot;&gt;Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-closing-countering-bias-through-diversity&quot;&gt;In Closing: Countering Bias Through Diversity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our country is changing, and so is the nature of government. Diversity is critical for all technology roles in government, not just leadership. Addressing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0739MF8VF/&quot;&gt;systemic bias in the tools&lt;/a&gt; that agencies are implementing will require attention from all levels of staff. Our benefit systems must provide services equitably to all, but this will be impossible without acknowledging these biases. However, due to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-race-sex-stereotyping/&quot;&gt;recent Executive Order&lt;/a&gt;, training around bias has largely been halted in the Federal government, reducing our ability to tackle this challenge. As the government begins to close gaps around technology skills, it is critical that we’re building a workforce that reflects the people we serve, so that we can better address these issues at their root.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;This article is part one in a &lt;a href=&quot;/policy-recs/&quot;&gt;series on IT policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. A PDF of the full recommendations may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2020/12/IT-Policy-Recommendations-2021-2024.pdf&quot;&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work improving technology in government through policy initiatives over the last twelve years has been very successful, however there will always be more work that needs to be done. Today, there are several key steps that the Biden Administration could immediately address and work on over the next four years to continue to build trust and drive maturity in technology across government to “Build Back Better” — not just at the Federal level, but state and local as well. These steps include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Renew the Commitment to Open Data &amp;amp; Transparency&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on Outcomes, not Box-Checking&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drive Customer Experience &amp;amp; Human-Centered Design&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solve Identity Once and for All&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase Attention to Small Agencies and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manage Risk through Security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last ten years working on civic tech from local to Federal levels, inside and outside of government, and have been excited to see incredible gains in the government’s ability to deliver services to constituents. After the Obama Presidency, the work to drive innovation in government didn’t suddenly stop — the Trump Administration pursued an aggressive agenda of IT Modernization. This included a major effort to update a very large amount of outdated government technology guidance, laying the critical foundation for many modern technology practices and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2017–2019, I served in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO), where I worked on the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/&quot;&gt;Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, ”Cloud Smart.”&lt;/a&gt; I designed this strategy to drive maturity across the Federal Government by updating a variety of older, interrelated policies on cybersecurity, procurement, and workforce training. At the time, we had no idea that many of these initiatives, such as the update to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf&quot;&gt;Trusted Internet Connections policy&lt;/a&gt; (TIC), would be critical to enabling government-wide mission continuity during the COVID-19 response just a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the past 4 years spent in government, I have been able to see many opportunities for improvements that did not get as much attention as they deserve. What follows are a few policy areas that I believe would build trust and improve service delivery to the American people. These aren’t all major innovations, but these efforts are needed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://krusynth.medium.com/welcome-home-49c5c8146fe0&quot;&gt;Move Carefully and Fix Things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-renew-the-commitment-to-open-data--transparency&quot;&gt;1. Renew the Commitment to Open Data &amp;amp; Transparency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining the Federal Government, I spent years working for government transparency organizations including the Sunlight Foundation and the OpenGov Foundation. Although those and many other transparency organizations have shut their doors over the last four years, the need for transparency has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I no longer hold the naive belief that &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunlightfoundation.com/2009/05/26/brandeis-and-the-history-of-transparency/&quot;&gt;sunlight is the best disinfectant&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, disinfectant is a better disinfectant, and regularly putting in the work to keep things clean in the first place is critically important. Transparency is an active process, not an end in and of itself — and &lt;strong&gt;care will have to be given to rebuilding&lt;/strong&gt; some of the atrophied muscles within government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;share-data-on-the-fight-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;Share Data on the Fight Against COVID-19&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, to heal the country a new Administration will need to deal with not only the COVID-19 virus, but also the &lt;em&gt;disinformation virus&lt;/em&gt;. To do so effectively will require addressing public trust around information quality and availability. The Administration should &lt;strong&gt;focus on providing timely, accurate information&lt;/strong&gt; including infection rates from Health and Human Services (HHS), job numbers from the Department of Labor (DOL), housing data from Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and loan data from the Small Business Administration (SBA). By &lt;strong&gt;utilizing the new Chief Data Officers across government&lt;/strong&gt; installed as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1770&quot;&gt;Open, Public, Electronic and Necessary, (OPEN) Government Data Act&lt;/a&gt; signed into law in 2019, the Biden Administration would be able to gather and centralize the critical recovery data. Everyone loves shiny dashboards, but I would instead propose that &lt;strong&gt;sharing raw data&lt;/strong&gt; to allow independent analysis would be vastly more valuable than &lt;a href=&quot;https://towardsdatascience.com/dashboards-are-dead-b9f12eeb2ad2&quot;&gt;Yet Another Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revise-the-national-action-plan&quot;&gt;Revise the National Action Plan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.usa.gov/assets/files/NAP4-fourth-open-government-national-action-plan.pdf&quot;&gt;Fourth National Action Plan for Open Government&lt;/a&gt; (NAP4) — and the&lt;a href=&quot;https://e-pluribusunum.org/2019/02/22/after-years-of-delays-and-democratic-regression-usa-releases-weak-open-government-plan/&quot;&gt; challenges the Trump Administration faced in delivering this plan&lt;/a&gt; — are matters of public record. As we look towards the Fifth National Action Plan, it will be critical to improve engagement with the public and open government groups. Since most of the country has quickly become accustomed to remote collaboration due to the pandemic, I would recommend &lt;strong&gt;hosting a variety of virtual forums beyond the DC area&lt;/strong&gt; to maximize input and idea-generation outside of the beltway. In addition to bringing in more stakeholders from across the country, this would also aid in empowering &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/11/23/is-coronavirus-catalyzing-new-civic-collaborations-for-open-government-pub-83289&quot;&gt;grassroots-initiated activities towards anti-corruption practices&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also recommend starting this process as early as possible to develop and gain traction around high-quality, ambitious commitments. There are also more than a few initiatives that civil society has proposed over the last decade that are worthy of reconsideration, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GSA/participate-nap4/issues&quot;&gt;these from the NAP4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;revise-agency-open-government-plans&quot;&gt;Revise Agency Open Government Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this work, OMB will need to update the long-neglected &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government&quot;&gt;Agency Open Government Plans guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m-16-16.pdf&quot;&gt;revised since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Although most agencies have updated their Open Government plans since then, more ambitious efforts to publish data are needed. Notably, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/OPEN/docs/open_govt_plan.pdf&quot;&gt;the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) have not updated their plan since 2010&lt;/a&gt;, even though more scrutiny has been paid to them by Congress during this time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-14-02603-178.pdf&quot;&gt;The VA Inspector General also previously identified&lt;/a&gt; that the VA had been actively working to undermine efforts to measure their progress on improving patient wait times, as a result of simply not recording data on the topic. With the new, $5 billion Electronic Health Records (EHR) system being implemented today, it is even more urgent that the VA improve their transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;all Federal agencies should be directed to more aggressively and proactively publish data&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of just as a response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Throughout the Trump Administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunlightfoundation.com/web-integrity-project/monitoring-federal-websites/&quot;&gt;key datasets have been removed from government websites.&lt;/a&gt; The new Administration can both better tell its story and also build confidence in the American people using government services by &lt;strong&gt;working to restore key data and increasing the volume of information that is actively shared&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rebuild-the-office-of-science-and-technology-policy&quot;&gt;Rebuild The Office of Science and Technology Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), headed by the Federal Chief Technology Officer, was previously the center of open government work under the Obama Administration, but this office and its authority were dramatically reduced over the last four years, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2017/3/31/15139966/trump-white-house-technology-science-policy&quot;&gt;staff cut from 150 to less than 50&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, &lt;strong&gt;major reconstitution of OSTP and other offices will need to be done&lt;/strong&gt; to drive these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-focus-on-outcomes-not-box-checking&quot;&gt;2. Focus on Outcomes, Not Box-Checking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;narrow-oversight-focus-to-high-impact-projects&quot;&gt;Narrow Oversight Focus to High-Impact Projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transparency goes hand-in-hand with oversight. The Office of Management and Budget is the primary oversight organization within the Executive Branch (other than Inspectors General), and is organized into smaller domain-specific offices. Staff in these program offices act as “desk officers,” focusing primarily on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officers_Act&quot;&gt;the 24 large CFO Act Agencies&lt;/a&gt;. For smaller offices, a* *single individual may be tasked with oversight of several agencies’ billion dollar budgets. OMB’s OFCIO is one such smaller office that has been stretched thin in this oversight duty while having to simultaneously fulfill a variety of policymaking roles. However, the primary role of this office is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3602&quot;&gt;to oversee technology implementation across government&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the success of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the few remaining staff, rather than being stretched thin on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cio.gov/policies-and-priorities/cpic/&quot;&gt;meaningless compliance&lt;/a&gt;, these resources could be better spent primarily focusing on only the &lt;strong&gt;top five or ten major technology projects in government and making sure that they do not fail&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-238&quot;&gt;in the way we saw happen with Healthcare.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Projects such as the State Department’s passport &amp;amp; visa modernization, the Department of Veterans Affairs new EHR system, and other similar initiatives could greatly benefit from closer scrutiny. By investing in hiring subject matter experts with skills in technology and managing massive projects, the government could save taxpayers billions of dollars while simultaneously improving services. OFCIO should also collaborate closely with the Office of Performance and Personnel Management (OPPM) which oversees the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf&quot;&gt;Customer Experience initiative&lt;/a&gt; across government to make sure that these projects also meet the needs of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restore-and-expand-the-office-of-the-federal-chief-information-officer&quot;&gt;Restore and Expand The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, OFCIO shares its limited budget with the U.S. Digital Service’s (USDS) core operations via the Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR) Fund, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meritalk.com/articles/omb-director-defends-cuts-to-it-oversight-budget/&quot;&gt;which was slashed dramatically under the Trump Administration&lt;/a&gt;. More than just paying for staff salaries, this fund is used to fund a variety of key technology oversight projects, such as the government’s software code sharing initiative, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.gov/&quot;&gt;code.gov&lt;/a&gt;. Cuts to this fund have caused OFCIO to eliminate programs like pulse.cio.gov, which monitored and evaluated the maturity and security of agency websites. Moreover, this fund is &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; and can be used by OMB to fund interesting technology initiatives at other agencies. The new Administration should &lt;strong&gt;restore the ITOR budget&lt;/strong&gt;. It would also be useful to further supplement this fund by taking the step of working with Congress to set &lt;strong&gt;appropriations to ensure the future of OFCIO and USDS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like OSTP, OFCIO has experienced large setbacks. The constant budget cuts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/22/federal-tech-strategy-spies-cybercriminals-1283773&quot;&gt;toxic culture&lt;/a&gt; have decimated the office, and most of the talented &amp;amp; passionate subject matter experts I served with have since left. Reversing the course on this office, and &lt;strong&gt;investing in hiring experts&lt;/strong&gt; with practical experience in &lt;em&gt;technology in government&lt;/em&gt; — not just Silicon Valley thought leadership solutionism — in these offices and beyond will be critical for the success of Federal IT for the next four years. This will improve both the quality of policy that is created as well as the outcomes of IT projects governmentwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-drive-customer-experience--human-centered-design&quot;&gt;3. Drive Customer Experience &amp;amp; Human-Centered Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically the government spends hundreds of millions of dollars on major IT projects. However, very little work is typically done to make sure that the right thing is being built — or if the right problem is even being solved. And sadly, newer systems are not always better systems. However, initiatives on Human-Centered Design (HCD) — a process to engage service recipients as stakeholders in the design and implementation of those services and systems — that were &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/09/04/using-human-centered-design-make-government-work-better-and-cost-less&quot;&gt;started under the Obama administration&lt;/a&gt; were built upon over the last four years. For instance, common private sector practices like user research and testing were previously considered difficult in government because of review &amp;amp; approval requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, but using &lt;a href=&quot;https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/&quot;&gt;streamlined processes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/guidance/fast-track-clearance-process.html&quot;&gt;blanket-permission requests&lt;/a&gt; these barriers have largely been eliminated for most agencies. &lt;strong&gt;These efforts need continued attention and support to maintain the momentum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drive-commitment-to-human-centered-design-across-omb&quot;&gt;Drive Commitment to Human-Centered Design Across OMB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At OMB, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Performance &amp;amp; Personnel Management office worked to institutionalize much of this work over the last four years, including new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.performance.gov/cx/a11-280.pdf&quot;&gt;governmentwide Customer Experience (CX) metrics guidance&lt;/a&gt; and a related &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.performance.gov/cx/&quot;&gt;Cross-Agency Priority Goal&lt;/a&gt; as part of the President’s Management Agenda. These metrics should be considered table stakes for driving customer experience, and much more work must be done in this area. For instance, every major (and possibly even minor!) &lt;strong&gt;IT project should have CX metrics defined as part of its requirements&lt;/strong&gt;, and these should be tracked throughout the life of the project. For existing projects, these should be created retroactively — starting with the highest-impact public-serving systems — with adequate baselines so that agencies don’t just receive an “easy A.” The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://coe.gsa.gov/docs/2020/Customer%20Experience%20Playbook-Nov%202020.pdf&quot;&gt;General Services Administration (GSA) Playbook on CX&lt;/a&gt; may provide a great starting point for most agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fix-the-definition-of-agile&quot;&gt;Fix the Definition of Agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this customer experience work is not a new idea — in fact, this sort of Human-Centered Design is a core tenet of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;Agile software development.&lt;/a&gt; Unfortunately, the Federal Government has completely missed the forest for the trees on the principles of Agile, and almost all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1232/text&quot;&gt;law and regulation&lt;/a&gt; focuses entirely on one area: incremental development, delivering software in small, working chunks over time, instead of delivering a full solution at the end of a lengthy development process. However, the real value of Agile is not in these small chunks, but rather in regular testing – both automated as well as having &lt;strong&gt;actual members of the public using the service directly involved in the development process&lt;/strong&gt; to give feedback as the project progresses. In this way, teams can make sure their software works and is actually solving problems for people using the service, instead of &lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; what the people served want. In the private sector we joke that you’ll have testing either way — would you rather do it before your product launches when you can get ahead of the issues, or after when it’s a public embarrassment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, agencies are required to report on their major IT investments and state if these projects are developed “incrementally,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf&quot;&gt;defined in guidance at the depressingly-low rate of once every six months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;OMB could refine their guidance to add additional Agile characteristics, including the requirement that software is tested throughout the development process with real customers.&lt;/strong&gt; This alone would dramatically decrease the number of failed projects in government, saving potentially billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fund-great-customer-experience&quot;&gt;Fund Great Customer Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all of this work requires expertise to be done well, and expertise comes at a cost. Champions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedscoop.com/white-house-agencies-cxos/&quot;&gt;Matt Lira have called for the creation of Chief Customer Experience Officers (CXOs)&lt;/a&gt; within agencies, which would be an excellent next step. However, we must not repeat the mistake of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text&quot;&gt;creation of the Chief Data Officer (CDO)&lt;/a&gt; roles, where additional funding was not dedicated for these new roles or their staff – as a result this became yet another hat for the CIO to wear at most agencies. &lt;strong&gt;Agencies will need to have increased funding in the President’s Budget to both hire new CX experts as well as to fund contracts to support these efforts CX efforts government-wide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-solve-identity-once-and-for-all&quot;&gt;4. Solve Identity Once and for All&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurately verifying a person’s identity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/&quot;&gt;satisfy Federal requirements&lt;/a&gt;, as well as creating a secure environment to allow them to login to Federal websites &amp;amp; tools, is a difficult and expensive task for all agencies. This also remains one of the biggest challenges for both agencies and the people accessing government services today. Most agencies have multiple login systems, each specifically tied to an individual service and without sharing information. For instance at the Department of Veterans Affairs until very recently there were nearly a dozen different login systems. Each of these systems would require you to prove that you are who you say you are separately as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandate-logingov&quot;&gt;Mandate Login.gov&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the GSA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://login.gov/&quot;&gt;Login.gov&lt;/a&gt; is an easy solution to this problem, and has been an overwhelming success for many agency services, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usajobs.gov/&quot;&gt;USAJobs&lt;/a&gt;, the website for most Federal job postings and application processes. Login.gov provides a simple solution to the very expensive problem of checking the identity of a member of the public and allowing them to login to a government website or application — to receive government benefits, register their small business, or any number of other services. This identity-proofing step is typically the most expensive part of the process, requiring the use of independent, private data sources like those used by our national credit bureaus. With Login.gov, once you’re verified on one site you’re verified at them all, so the cost for taxpayers is &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt; reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some agencies are starting to move to this platform, a new administration should &lt;strong&gt;mandate all agencies must use Login.gov&lt;/strong&gt;, and require them to &lt;strong&gt;provide a transition plan to this service within 5 years&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, usage of Login.gov is &lt;strong&gt;already required by law&lt;/strong&gt;, but the law is simply not being followed (&lt;a href=&quot;https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section1523&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim&quot;&gt;6 U.S.C. 1523(b)(1)(D)&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of just an &lt;strong&gt;unfunded mandate,&lt;/strong&gt; the President’s Budget should include a request for Congress to provide appropriations directly to GSA to fund these efforts to ensure this product is sustainable well into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-usps-for-in-person-identity-proofing&quot;&gt;Use USPS for In-Person Identity Proofing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the VA we also learned that many people have trouble with identity proofing over the internet for a number of reasons, including problems with having suitable cameras for capturing information from IDs, issues with people’s memory that preclude standard address verification methods, and other issues. However, we found that people were much more likely to be successful by having their identity validated by humans in-person at VA hospitals. The US Postal Service (USPS) has &lt;a href=&quot;https://gcn.com/articles/2013/01/28/usps-pilot-cloud-federal-id-credential-hub.aspx?sc_lang=en&quot;&gt;successfully piloted a service to check people’s identity&lt;/a&gt; in-person at both USPS locations and at people’s homes using their existing portable tablets used for mail delivery. &lt;strong&gt;By working with Congress to help fund this service&lt;/strong&gt;, identity verification could be a solved problem, while also providing a sustainable additional revenue stream for the desperately-underfunded USPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;share-these-services-with-state--local-governments&quot;&gt;Share these Services with State &amp;amp; Local Governments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, &lt;strong&gt;these services should be offered to state and local governments&lt;/strong&gt;, who are incredibly eager for these solutions, coupled with the expertise of the Federal government. For instance, the same login that you use for USAJobs could be used to login to your local DMV, once again making government easier and friendlier for everyone. To date, GSA leadership has not actively allowed sales to these governments, even though it is &lt;em&gt;explicitly allowed under law&lt;/em&gt; and other similar services have been allowed, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.gov/&quot;&gt;Cloud.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The White House should direct &lt;strong&gt;GSA to provide this service to any government agency who wants it — and even to the private sector where appropriate!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8048/text&quot;&gt;Recent bills in Congress&lt;/a&gt; have also prioritized security for state and local governments, so it would not be unreasonable to go even further and &lt;strong&gt;work with Congress to set appropriations to provide this identity service&lt;/strong&gt; to them as well. Working closely with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cisa.gov/&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&lt;/a&gt;, GSA could turn this from a small project into a national program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-increase-attention-to-small-agencies&quot;&gt;5. Increase Attention to Small Agencies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nearly a hundred smaller independent agencies that are not situated under the President’s Cabinet, and as a result they are largely ignored. However, they still have critically important missions, and these agencies also interface with the bigger agencies to exchange data, presenting a number of potential security concerns and operational risks. Although a focus on projects and outcomes — not just compliance — is critical, OMB needs to pay more attention to these smaller agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is a small independent agency of only 4000 people, but is tasked with protecting investors and the national banking system, as a result of the stock market crash in the 1920s. As such a small agency, they don’t have nearly the budget for IT and cybersecurity of the large agencies. However, since they exchange data with the Department of the Treasury, they act as a backdoor into the larger agency. This sort of attack, by exploiting a softer target to gain access to a more secure one, is extremely common on the smaller scale and will inevitably become a focus for hostile nation-states in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fund-small-agencies-it&quot;&gt;Fund Small Agencies’ IT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smaller agencies will need additional resources to be able to deal with these threats while also keeping their services up-to-date. OMB can take the much-needed step of** requesting larger IT budgets for these agencies.** Furthermore, to date no small agencies have been selected for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tmf.cio.gov/&quot;&gt;Technology Modernization Funds&lt;/a&gt; — a “loan program” for agencies to fund IT projects — to help them improve their IT. Meanwhile massive organizations such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) — who have an annual budget of &lt;em&gt;17 billion dollars *and are not in any way short of money — have received an *additional&lt;/em&gt; 15 million dollars from this fund to update their legacy financial systems. Providing access to further funds for smaller agencies would give them an opportunity to improve their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drive-shared-service-use&quot;&gt;Drive Shared Service Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared IT services are even more important for these agencies as well. In many cases the Chief Information Officer (CIO) will wear many hats — acting as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Data Officer (CDO), and other roles. To be successful while being stretched so thin means that staff must take advantage of the capabilities of the bigger agencies to help them fill their gaps, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/jmd/cybersecurity-services&quot;&gt;Department of Justice’s Security Operations Center-as-a-Service offering&lt;/a&gt;. The idea of a “CIO in a Box” for the smaller agencies has been brought up several times, providing information, services, and resources to these organizations. However, very little movement has been made on this initiative and this is &lt;strong&gt;a large opportunity for further work and investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other shared services, including the aforementioned Login.gov and Cloud.gov also would provide major benefits to smaller agencies, especially if the &lt;strong&gt;President’s budget included additional dedicated funding to GSA for these projects for small agencies&lt;/strong&gt;, so that they don’t have to scrape together the money out of their own limited budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-manage-risk-through-security&quot;&gt;6. Manage Risk through Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common theme here is that cybersecurity remains one of the greatest challenges for technology in government today. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) sets many of the legal requirements for cybersecurity in government, and in practice this has transformed risk management into &lt;em&gt;risk avoidance&lt;/em&gt;, reducing the overall risk tolerance for agencies and freezing any interest in trying new things. There is little hope of Congress fixing FISMA in the near future, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4785/text&quot;&gt;attempts to date only will make things worse&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, &lt;strong&gt;the Biden Administration could supplement ongoing initiatives for security automation with additional resources, and implement the resulting best practices as official policy governmentwide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;continuous-security-authorization-of-it-systems&quot;&gt;Continuous Security Authorization of IT Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of IT security in government is the Authorization to Operate(ATO) process. If you’ve ever worked for the government, I’m sure you groaned just having to read that phrase. FISMA requires that for all IT systems, agencies must implement a series of “security controls” — &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53&quot;&gt;measures defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to enhance security&lt;/a&gt;. Now, this is an extremely laborious process, and a new product may take months to meet the requirements of a security review. This process generates a lot of paperwork — enough to stop bullets, but this isn’t very effective for keeping out nefarious attackers. Many agencies only have a three-year cycle of re-assessing products for these security controls — basically only checking to see if the door is locked once every few years. Moreover, the interpretation and implementation of these controls differ wildly between agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several agencies have started separate pilots to improve the consistency and speed of this process. For instance, some agencies are working to implement a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/innovation/2014/12/10/it-security-security-in-an-agile-development-cloud-world-by-kurt-garbars/&quot;&gt;“lightweight authorization to operate” (LATO)&lt;/a&gt; or a “progressive authorization to operate” process where only a subset of the security controls must be reviewed to begin &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt; on a platform, with further controls added along the way before launching the application for public use. Others are moving to “continuous authorization,” a concept similar to &lt;em&gt;continuous integration&lt;/em&gt; for software testing, by using standard tools to automatically check the various security controls on an ongoing basis — providing real-time visibility to the security of the systems. Still other agencies are working to standardize security plan language, or use natural language processing (NLP) as a means of reviewing paperwork-heavy controls faster. These efforts also relate to NIST’s efforts to standardize controls via a machine-readable structure called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/&quot;&gt;OSCAL&lt;/a&gt;, which is now being used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fedramp.gov/FedRAMP-moves-to-automate-the-authorization-process/&quot;&gt;GSA’s FedRAMP program&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these efforts were previously being replicated via the CIO Council, but with the exodus of OFCIO staff efforts have stalled out. These efforts should be &lt;strong&gt;spread across government via additional funding, staffing, and more pilots&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the policy areas that need attention in technology in government. There are still other agency-specific projects that need further attention that I haven’t covered here. However, these specific areas of focus will continue to build back better technology in government, and equip us with the necessary tools for the next decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Hiring and Programming Tests</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/11/programming-tests/" />

  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2020/12/11/programming-tests/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to call anyone out, but I want to talk about programming tests in hiring and contracting. &lt;em&gt;Stop doing them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post originally appeared as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krusynth/status/1337397081019969537&quot;&gt;a thread on my Twitter
account&lt;/a&gt;.
I’ve reposted it here for posterity with additional context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that people want to assess whether or not someone is capable of doing the job at hand.  The problem is that every engineer, no matter how senior, is learning on the job, EVERY DAY. All of us lookup solutions on the internet, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your assumption of what should be “baseline knowledge” for one person is based on your own experience. If you learned programming in college, a bubble sort algorithm is probably just muscle-memory by now; for the rest of us, it’s completely irrelevant knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has nothing to do with 99.9999% of jobs. Unless you’re working on some bleeding-edge optimization for a major, that sort of fiddly info is way less relevant that principles and practices. It’s just a great way of showing your biases towards “traditional” candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst interview a company ever gave me was to implement a hashing algorithm. I’ve been writing code for 35 years, I’ve never had to do this manually. I failed. It also told me the company didn’t know what to ask me, I immediately withdrew my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech isn’t about algo knowledge. Bad news to my younger-self: it’s also not about passion. It’s about knowing how to solve problems. Instead of coding exercises here are a few ways to figure out if someone will be a match for the job you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: don’t ask questions that have a single, expected answer. If you know what the answer is, you’ve created a knowledge-based test - and just like with authentication, you’ve created a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them about a problem they’ve solved recently, have them outline the steps they went through.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them about a piece of technology that has made their life easier in some way. Whether it’s a build tool or kitchen gadget, how does this relate to what we do?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them what new tools they are excited about, and what makes their life as a developer better? (I specifically avoid saying “fun” here, because working for a paycheck not passion is a perfectly valid reason to be a technologist.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to hire senior developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them about building for audiences that are not like them? How do we create solutions for inclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them about why they chose to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use a piece of technology. How did they evaluate it? Cost, maturity, stability, community?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask them what makes a good culture for a team.  What makes a team productive and empowered?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;h/t &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/justgrimes&quot;&gt;@justgrimes&lt;/a&gt;: Ask them to explain how the internet works. Details don’t matter, you want to see if they can read a room and communicate to the level of their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite EQ question is “what’s the last good thing you’ve read.” Book/blog/T&amp;amp;Cs/etc. I always add the answers to my reading list - but also high EQ people will usually reflect the question and ask you back. (Unless they’re nervous, so DON’T go on this alone!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other ideas I received on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abbeysuekos&quot;&gt;@abbeysuekos&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m also starting to get into questions about how people work with those above them (managers/leaders/executives) and those below them (ICs). There are never enough ?s about how you treat people with less power than you… I love questions about projects that didn’t go well. Plenty of good candidates will struggle or even get defensive, and that’s a flag for me. Important to handle the framing carefully and create an explicit safe space, but when done well it’s golden.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HimalMandalia&quot;&gt;@HimalMandalia&lt;/a&gt;: “Had an interesting experience with a tech test years ago. Turned out it was one I’d done already, so told them and said “how about instead I show you and talk through what I’m working on at my current place?” They agreed. So did just that. Got the job.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have other questions you use to help identify talented candidates, without jumping through programming test hoops? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krusynth/status/1337397092457865216&quot;&gt;Tell me about it here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I see many of my former technology-colleagues now suddenly eager to
return to government- or join for the first time- and I’m very excited
to work with you all again! That being said, here are a few thoughts
from someone who stuck around for the hard parts over the last 4
years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Update February 6th, 2021: This little post has gotten way more attention than I ever could have expected! If you’d like to show everyone that you also want to &lt;strong&gt;Move Carefully and Fix Things&lt;/strong&gt;, I’d like to send you a sticker &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;/move-carefully/&quot;&gt;Here’s how to get yours!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;Update February 14th, 2021: This post is now a &lt;a href=&quot;//billhunt.dev/uploads/2021/02/welcome-home-zine.pdf&quot;&gt;free downloadable print-and-fold zine&lt;/a&gt;! You can find folding &lt;a href=&quot;#instructions-for-the-zine&quot;&gt;instructions at the bottom of this page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post originally appeared as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/krusynth/status/1325804228426805248&quot;&gt;a thread on my Twitter
account&lt;/a&gt;.
I’ve reposted it here for posterity with additional context. This was
originally a very short thread, but if you want to delve deeper into
these topics, I highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cydharrell&quot;&gt;Cyd
Harrell&lt;/a&gt;’s
fantastic book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cydharrell.com/book/&quot;&gt;A Civic Technologist’s Practice
Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&quot;spaced-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Move fast and break things” failed. As a result, we inherited a
lot of fast-moving broken things. Sustainability is the most important
principle in government tech today. &lt;strong&gt;“Move carefully and fix
things.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Build with, not for” -
&lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/buildwith&quot;&gt;Cuán McCann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(that one is still the most important and gets its own tweet)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note: Cuán’s talk at CFA Summit in 2014 begins with “At the
 risk of creating a massive existential crisis…” and the following
 five minutes created one for me. It completely changed how I look at the
 world and approach The Work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbqNkz_mjng&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technology is &lt;em&gt;almost never&lt;/em&gt; the solution to the problem. You need
a deep understanding of culture, policy, budget, acquisitions, etc. to
be successful. We don’t need &lt;strong&gt;ANY&lt;/strong&gt; more shiny new websites or
hackathons. Your first year should be spent understanding the
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fam, choose boring tech over shiny. Those mainframes and COBOL still
work just fine after 50 years of service. Those React apps you’re
writing are legacy before they launch, at a hundred times the cost, and
no one can run them when you leave - making them abandonware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government doesn’t need disruption, or even innovation. Many of us
who came in as “innovators” are now the career bureaucrats just
keeping the place from burning down. Listen to our expertise and work
with us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People don’t want to hear this, but… this isn’t a job for
tourists. Building relationships to cause change takes time. If people
know you have one foot out the door, they’re not going to trust you.
Think about what you’re willing to sacrifice before signing up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all being said… Welcome Home. I’m looking forward to
collaborating with you all soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instructions-for-the-zine&quot;&gt;Instructions for the Zine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;featured&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;//billhunt.dev/uploads/2021/02/zine-instructions.png&quot; alt=&quot;Folding instructions for the zine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;featured&quot;&gt;Once folded, the outside should have Welcome Home on both the front and back, and the first pages upon opening should be 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Secret Equation of Job Satisfaction</title>
  <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://billhunt.dev/blog/2018/12/16/the-secret-equation-of-job-satisfaction/" />
  <published>2018-12-17T01:48:34+00:00</published>
  <updated>2018-12-17T01:48:34+00:00</updated>
  <id>https://billhunt.dev/blog/2018/12/16/the-secret-equation-of-job-satisfaction/</id>
  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;Many lengthy books and articles have been written on how to be fulfilled at work, good management, and keeping your staff engaged and excited. However, I’ve found one simple equation that is the secret to all of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/12/satisfaction_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;Satisfaction = &quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/12/satisfaction_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;Volition / Friction&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not satisfied with your job, it’s probably because you don’t feel effective or that your work has the desired outcome – your &lt;em&gt;volition&lt;/em&gt;, or because there’s too much resistance, bureaucracy, barriers, and day-to-day minutiae for you to enjoy the work – the &lt;em&gt;friction&lt;/em&gt;.  Satisfaction is a measure of your volition over the job’s friction. More volition increases satisfaction, as does less friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that your control over your job is around 5 on some magical undefined scale – you can do the things you need to some of the time. However, the amount of paperwork you have to fill out to do the job is around a 10.  5/10 = ½, so you’re probably not going to be very satisfied. On the other hand, if you have lots of control and can make all the decisions you need – let’s call this 10 – and you have no daily design-by-committee meetings to wrangle – let’s give this one a 2, you’re at 10/2 = 5, which is looking pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t really need the scale or the points here, it’s just to show how the two relate to each other. The ratio of volition to friction will determine your level of job satisfaction. Research suggests that people feel most fulfilled when they are being challenged just beyond their current capacity. Too little challenge or too much challenge become either boring or overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although being able to direct your work is the most obvious component of volition, it can include many supplementary factors. The alignment of your skills and background to your work can impact your volition. Feeling that your work has an impact on the world can also be a major element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friction is comprised of several components as well. If your organization has unnecessary processes and procedures, those barriers to productivity will cause friction. If you work more than 40 hours per week or your commute is long that will likely cause friction by cutting into personal time. If your organization requires extensive reviews and buy-in from multiple stakeholders to accomplish tasks that may cause friction. Anything that causes you to become quickly exhausted at your job is likely adding to the friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To increase your job satisfaction, you’ll need to increase your volition in the job or decrease your friction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase your volition you can take many steps in your current job.  This includes outsourcing or delegating unwanted tasks, taking on different projects that you enjoy more than your current projects, learn key information or skills, increase the level of challenge by taking on harder projects, decrease the level of challenge by collaborating with experts.  To dramatically increase your volition you may need to find a new job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To decrease the level of friction there are many things to do as well.  You can outsource and delegate tasks to decrease your weekly hours. You can work from home several days to decrease your weekly commute time.  You can decrease the number of weekly meetings with your teams. Any of these can make the job feel easier even if the workload hasn’t decreased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say that there aren’t terrible jobs in the world that no one would ever enjoy. You may be in a job where neither of these variables can be changed enough to make a major impact on your happiness. It’s a good idea to regularly assess where you’re at on this scale just to make sure your satisfaction isn’t slipping away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with Agile methodologies, this should sound somewhat familiar. “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools” is a core tenet of the Agile approach. Putting the individual in control and reducing the cruft of processes is just good practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a manager&lt;/strong&gt;, I often use this equation to help increase my staff’s satisfaction as well. I may not be able to always give a staff member more control over their work, but I can drop half of our check-in meetings to free up their time, or find ways to reduce the amount of paperwork they have to file to do their job. However, in many cases I can do both at once – by allowing staff to act independently in their projects with less oversight. This brings up another equation that I’m fond of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/12/delivery.png&quot; alt=&quot;Trust + Autonomy = Delivery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, if you hire good, talented people, all you need to do is &lt;em&gt;trust _them to do their job and give them the _autonomy&lt;/em&gt; they need to do it, and they’ll &lt;em&gt;deliver&lt;/em&gt; good work. (Buckminster Fuller talks about this in Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, in describing the “Great Pirates.”) Giving your people the space they need to execute and support they need to see their work through will build trust and autonomy. Best of all, trust can increase volition, and autonomy can decrease friction, resulting in delivery &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of these components can be broken down into various topics for in depth study.  The high level equation helps identify what the missing component is to getting the desired results.  I hope you’ll keep this equation in mind when you’re approaching your own work, and see if you can find ways of creating a better balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Hype Market</title>

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;It takes time, money, and other resources to execute on any new information technology initiative. In theory, there should be a return on investment for any new IT development. However, in the current market landscape, a lot of effort is being wasted on reinventing the wheel or misapplying solutions, rather than driving towards proving greater value to citizens and customers. The relatively low cost of experimentation and implementation of processes result in a fetishization of abstraction, leading to further and further complexity even if a proportional benefit is not achieved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-is-a-bridge&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Technology is a Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most businesses and government services aim to connect a person’s intention to an outcome. Whether we’re helping someone call a restaurant to make a reservation, or helping a Veteran to understand their benefits, we’re aiding someone to solve a problem. In short, we’re bridging the gap between a customer and a service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1241&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/1-user-service.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Technology is introduced into the process of delivering a service to a customer to automate one or more steps, it effectively shortens the gap. In general, technology is not seamless in this process – that is, there are almost always steps between the customer’s intent and the resulting action that have to be filled through human intervention or additional services. You can’t think “pizza” and have a pizza instantly appear  – but an app to order pizza removes some of the burden of calling the pizza place and having them take your order, prepare it, and deliver it to your doorstep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1242&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/2-technology.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Today there are new automation tools available to practitioners who want to create access to services through technology. If you want to create a service so that someone is able to order a pizza, you can set up a website or a mobile app to do so, because there’s already computers, and the Internet, and web browsers on the computers, and protocols for everything to talk to each other. So for anyone trying to solve a problem, the real value is in making the process simpler or easier through &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;further&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;automation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;– say, having your website be able to actually show the order automatically at the pizza place on a screen, or automatically send you a text when the pizza is out for delivery with an ETA. Based on the previous diagram, the goal is to expand the boundaries of technology to further fill the gaps between the customer and the service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1243&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/3-potential-value.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;However, that gap is not where the technology industry focus most of its time and money. Software engineers are spending more and more of our resources mucking about with tools that are simply thinner and thinner slices of micromanagement around already-solved problems. In practice, the industry is just creating additional layers that are largely unnecessary for the end customer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1244&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/4-complexity.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Here’s a real world example, again using a website.  In 1998, it took a few hours to set up a website. Most of our time was spent on designing it, then hand-coding HTML to post on a webserver.  As our tools evolved, the time to perform these steps decreased, but the complexity of the tools themselves has increased dramatically. Today, it can take ten times as long to create a basic website as it did decades ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1245&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/5-website.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;After twenty years, technology has moved a little closer to the person requesting the information due to improved User Experience, and the end user can get to the information a little faster and easier, but mostly there’s lots of additional complexity in the middle layers. These middle layers have created a very rich market of expensive services and skills based on these bleeding-edge technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-a-parable&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Blockchain: A Parable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;As a result, the world has seen the rise of numerous solutions with overblown promises of impact, fueled by speculation of venture capital. Blockchain (or distributed ledgers) is a popular example, which has elevated itself with an innate brand of “value” due to being associated with Bitcoin, a popular cryptocurrency using the technology. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1246&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/bc-1-traditional.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Most computer systems take data from one person, put it into a storage location (usually a database), and then output it for someone else’s review. One problem that people have with these systems is that there’s no way to validate that the data submitted by the first person is the same as what the person on the other end receives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1247&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/bc-2-vulnerabilities.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;There are numerous points along that path where a malicious actor – or broken process – can modify or corrupt the data. That can be a hacker exploiting a vulnerable system, data corruption due to failed hardware, or any number of other failures. The submitting person could also just be lying about the data, or the person receiving it could lie about the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1248&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/bc-3-think.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Companies selling blockchain as a solution make the promise that these points of failure can be eliminated by having an authoritative record – or ledger – of all changes to the data. However, in reality, blockchain fulfills only a small piece of this process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1249&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/bc-4-real.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In most cases, it simply replaces the database with another type of database, which provides additional checks. This still doesn’t solve the original problem of ensuring that the data is valid on both ends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-1250&quot; src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/bc-5-vulnerabilities.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To visualize this, let’s say I have four apples.  I write down on paper that I have six apples. You read the paper and double check that I do in fact say that I have six apples. You have no proof I ever had six apples, only the promise that I did.  You could then go report that I have eight apples and that you double-checked that fact and you promise that it’s true. This is how blockchain gives a false sense of security.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addressing-the-market-forces&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Addressing the Market Forces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;And still the sales pitch still works!  Companies are spending millions to adopt “blockchain” technologies – many of which are so stripped of features that they can’t even be called a distributed ledger anymore. But even if purchasers don’t know the difference, technologists must know that much of this additional complexity is merely hype. Why would software engineers want to use it in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;One way to consider this is that engineers obsess on generating higher and higher orders of abstraction. Abstraction, however, generally increases complexity by moving concerns to a higher order function.  Think of going from a wheelbarrow to a bicycle. Bicycles can reduce the amount of energy needed to move a load around due to gears – but those gears are also more complex than just an axle and wheels. Suddenly you have extra parts to keep up and grease, and to build them from scratch you’d need to understand the math behind gearing ratios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;With physical processes, resource limitations and cost-effectiveness become natural restrictions on automation. But in software, there are rarely such restrictions; rather, software developers are actively encouraged to create more complex tools, often as “side projects” outside of their main working hours – though frequently eschewing any hope of a healthy work-life balance. These developers and tools are given prominence on stage at most technology conferences, becoming superstars of the technology world and further adding to the hype. Very few people garner attention for solving common problems with common tools. (E.g., there are four major competing Javascript bundlers today, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, written in 1976, can do just about everything.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To look at this cynically, extra complexity means higher cost.  Technology as a business is largely about hype, the newest and coolest tools are a selling point for most tech-reliant industries (which is most industries). The rise of outsourcing overseas, to areas where costs are much lower, continues to drive down the cost of technology development in the west. But using all of these rapidly-evolving technologies increases the cost to develop, so engineers can demand higher salaries.  It’s only by continuing to evolve the market of solutions to newer and trendier alternatives that the system can maintain its value, otherwise everyone would all settle on a low-bar minimum baseline and scaffold from there – like using dumb “feature” phones with mail and chat features, instead of smart phones. But that wouldn’t allow anyone to maintain the higher prices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;These solutions are, as a result, extremely short-lived. Newer model iPhones come out annually.  And a new major Javascript framework establishes market dominance on the web every 18 to 36 months or so. Although at the time of writing we are in the height of React’s reign, we’ve already seen that market splinter and fragment, adding new layers within React, including Redux, Sagas, and others. Every piece of software released today is the legacy technology of tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This market churn makes it difficult for any new engineers to enter the workforce, as any skills learned in a developed curriculum will largely be out of date by the time the student graduates. Only full-time software engineers are able to compete, and they must dedicate a considerable part of their time to staying current, lest they fall behind and become unemployable.  Though, this will eventually give way to a secondary market of expensive engineers specializing in legacy systems, as seen during the Y2K panic. The Federal Government also continues to provide a welcome market for outdated technology skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-past-hype-through-accountability--simplicity&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Moving Past Hype Through Accountability &amp;amp; Simplicity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The hype cycle and automation cult isn’t going away anytime soon.  But we all – government and private sector alike – can work to be more cynical about the technologies presented to us, to dive deep on the topics, and look to experts to inform our opinions.  We can demand proven, reliable solutions with longevity instead of just the newest buzzwords. And we must plan for the inevitable economic downturns in the future that will impact the IT market, like we saw in the “dot com” crash of the late 1990s.  There will always be money to be had in IT, but the bubble must burst (again) eventually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Another thing we can do to combat this trend is to stand up for simplification; using the easiest – and most well known – solution will often be the most cost-effective.  This will inevitably erode the market, driving down costs and associated salaries, and reduce technology practitioners to skilled tradespeople like plumbers or electricians.  In this way, we can plan for a more stable future technology market, with far greater longevity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Through this dedicated effort and planning, we can focus our efforts on those areas of greater value instead, creating a more seamless Customer Experience which actually solves problems for people more efficiently and cheaply, instead of just making increasingly impressive profit margins for private companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;0e0c&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--figure&quot;&gt;
      Over the last few years, an increasing number of technology companies and agencies have adopted a flat hierarchical structure. This organizational system promises to improve the efficiency of organizations by removing management structures, leaving as few management layers as possible. I believe that it is also almost entirely imaginary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;c4b1&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      Since the popular game company &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-href=&quot;http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf&quot;&gt;Valve published its employee handbook online in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, companies have looked to the text for ways to improve their own processes. Growing companies stopped hiring middle level managers, project managers, and other critical roles in favor of letting engineers manage themselves. This was a very attractive move for smaller organizations, since it reduced the number of positions they needed to hire for, reducing their operating costs dramatically. For engineers it can be initially compelling to be able to set their own priorities amongst themselves — and potentially get an inflated title such as “Lead” or “VP” (but often with no additional compensation).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;a44d&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      Management is best done by managers
    &lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;d7c3&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--h3&quot;&gt;
      However, in practice, it’s rarely so simple. By serving dual roles on a team, performance often suffers as staff try to context shift. &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot; data-creator-ids=&quot;bdbae7b10ee6&quot;&gt;Good engineers do not automatically make good managers — &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-href=&quot;http://fractio.nl/2014/09/19/not-a-promotion-a-career-change/&quot;&gt;working with computers and working with people require very different skillsets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; A company wouldn’t expect a business manager to write code, so why should the reverse be encouraged?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote id=&quot;4847&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--blockquote-quote is-other&quot; data-creator-ids=&quot;2266a5fd21a&quot;&gt;“Flattening the org chart just means creating a hierarchy of emotional labor”&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;ec2f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote&quot;&gt;
      In a flat organization, it is no one’s dedicated job to handle many of the complex human interactions that a business must handle. At one organization, I found myself staying up late nights, writing human resource policies, vacation plans, and codes of conduct. From project management to conflict resolution, functions that are filled by dedicated staff in other businesses frequently become after-hours extra labor by engineering staff. So-called soft skills and human-oriented problems are treated as secondary to achieving product goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;824f&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      It may be necessary for staff to serve multiple roles initially for very small organizations to be able to function, but beyond the first dozen staff this is not a practical or ethical way to accomplish tasks. &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot; data-creator-ids=&quot;374bc14350c4 8bfc99121ab3 anon&quot;&gt;If you’re large enough to be thinking about insurance plans and snack delivery, you’re large enough to hire management.&lt;/span&gt; A good project manager or human resources officer is a much better investment than that a lavish office space will be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;38a4&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      Even in large companies, &lt;a class=&quot;markup--anchor markup--p-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; data-href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html&quot;&gt;it’s very common for women to be expected to perform administrative duties outside of their roles&lt;/a&gt;, such as taking notes or scheduling meetings. In flat organizations, it’s very common for many of the “extra” tasks to be assigned to women and minorities first. &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other&quot; data-creator-ids=&quot;bdbae7b10ee6&quot;&gt;The inherent cultural biases in technology only increases the odds that these groups will be expected to do more than their share.&lt;/span&gt; It’s also common for more junior staff to be assigned the less exciting work, for instance being assigned to fix bugs instead of writing new code.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;e2cb&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--h3 graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      Hierarchies form anyway, and unfairly
    &lt;/h3&gt;

        “A flat org just replaces vertical hierarchy with concentric levels of inner circleness… &lt;span class=&quot;markup--quote markup--blockquote-quote is-other&quot; data-creator-ids=&quot;8bfc99121ab3&quot;&gt;If you remove formality you can avoid accountability&lt;/span&gt; and responsibility with policy of openness that is a convention of silence in practice.”
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many organizations I’ve worked for, I’ve frequently seen talented staff passed over for promotion in favor of friends of company owners and managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p id=&quot;9202&quot; class=&quot;graf graf--p graf-after--p&quot;&gt;
      People, by nature, surround themselves with like-minded — and &lt;em class=&quot;markup--em markup--p-em&quot;&gt;like-cultured&lt;/em&gt; — individuals, creating echo chambers and consolidating power in in-groups. This almost always puts women and minorities at a disadvantage. In a structured organization formal policies on hiring and process can help to prevent the biases and inequalities that come from such in-groups, but a flat organization has no such defense from becoming a good ol’ boys club.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Although I was initially very excited about the prospect of flat organizations, I have yet to work in one that was effective. Modern business practices and the laws that govern them have mostly evolved to help create a more level playing field for employees. Although tech culture fetishizes rule breaking, disdain for authority, and meritocracy, these only contribute to the very toxic culture that has evolved. For the good of our industry, we could all do with a few more rules — and a few more managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  A few months ago, I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://sunlightfoundation.com/&quot;&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as their Senior Technology Adviser. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rightsduff&quot;&gt;Kat Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, who was then the Sunlight Labs director, brought me on to help bolster their programming efforts and lend support across the organization. However, only a couple of weeks later we learned that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;Sunlight Labs was being shut down entirely&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;!--more--&gt;With the time we had until the official closure, we quickly shifted our focus to

  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/11/01/sunlight-labs-update-nonprofits-step-up-to-preserve-tools-for-transparency/&quot;&gt;preserving the legacy of Labs’ work over the last decade&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  A quick inventory of our technology assets revealed hundreds of repositories and over fifty servers in various states of decay. A lot of effort would be required to preserve the data and tools for future use. What follows are a few of the lessons from this work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  It’s important to note that Sunlight Labs was never a traditional software development shop – it was always an incubator in which interesting ideas were cultivated. Resources were frequently limited, and delivering new tools and concepts was the top priority. Many of the tools created were never designed to be released. As anyone who’s worked under these constraints can attest, best methods and rigorous practice are often put aside to focus on delivery.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Begin with an end
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  The most important thing I’ve learned in the last few years is to start all projects with an end in mind. I’ve written previously about &lt;a href=&quot;https://krues8dr.com/blog/2016/09/27/the-end-of-the-second-act-of-civic-tech/&quot;&gt;the uncertain future of civic technology and nonprofit funding&lt;/a&gt;.  We can no longer take for granted that our projects will continue forever. Far too many civic technology projects have effectively become abandonware as a result of lack of foresight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  One effective way of preventing this is to begin your project by thinking about your end goals. Do you want to create a tool for other people to take and use? Is it good enough to simply release some data once and then move on? Is your project one that you’re willing to independently run indefinitely? How long can you expect to be able to work on it? What happens to the project if something happens to you or your organization?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Writing down all of your contingency plans in a public way can help to mitigate these problems when they inevitably come up later. Make sure that you would feel comfortable if you had to walk away from your work tomorrow. Setting a deadline for the end of your work, and communicating this information with stakeholders, can be useful as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  We all are aware of the critical importance of documenting our projects, yet few projects have good documentation. It can be very time-consuming to write down everything that a new person needs to know about your project, but this is absolutely critical work. I recommend doing as much of this work as possible up-front, and making it an integral part of your process moving forward. This is still useful even if your work isn’t writing code for computers – always take the time to write for humans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  In the same way that you have your peers review your work or that you write your tests, make sure to include writing documentation as a step in the process. Make a new rule for your team: if a feature doesn’t have documentation, it doesn’t get merged and it doesn’t ship.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Assume nothing. Although today you may have the luxury of showing every new team member how every system works as part of their onboarding process, that may change suddenly and without warning. Write as if your end user probably knows nothing about your internal process. Make sure you explain every step of using your tools – from getting the data to running and deploying the software. Give examples as frequently as possible, with screenshots and exact commands wherever it makes sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Licensing
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  As a general rule, if your code and/or data doesn’t have a license, no one else can use it. There are huge exceptions to this, but it is almost always easier to be explicit than to hire a legal team.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Since a large number of Sunlight’s projects did not have licenses, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krues8dr/project-migration&quot;&gt;created a tool to add licenses in bulk&lt;/a&gt; to all projects that were missing them.  We used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html&quot;&gt;GPLv3 license&lt;/a&gt; for most of these, as it is a strong license that requires sharing of modifications to code, helping to preserve these tools for future use.  There are lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://choosealicense.com/&quot;&gt;other good licenses&lt;/a&gt; to consider, however.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Keep a clean house
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  One of the more laborious tasks was preparing the many projects to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sunlightlabs&quot;&gt;shared publicly on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Since a large number of these project had only been stored on an internal GitLab server with no public access, many of them had secure secrets – passwords and API credentials – hardcoded into the source. Frequently, these credentials were stored outside of the usual settings files, and since the credentials were different on every project, tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/&quot;&gt;BFG&lt;/a&gt; were not enough to find all of them. Again, I ended up having to write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krues8dr/project-migration&quot;&gt;collection of tools&lt;/a&gt; to migrate repositories from GitLab to GitHub, to check for potentially problematic files, and to automatically remove credentials from those files. Even after that, it still required many hours of manually reviewing code to check for stray credentials.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  For most projects, it’s a better idea to never check in any secure credentials to your repositories in the first place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://12factor.net/config&quot;&gt;Storing these in the environment instead&lt;/a&gt; is a common way of avoiding this situation. If that’s too complicated for any reason, you can always simply use standard configuration files and have Git (or whatever version control tool you prefer) ignore them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Do remember to keep an example of your configuration file in the repository and up-to-date, though. In one case we were unable to deploy updated code to our server due to an incomplete Fabric configuration, and had to update the code manually on the live server as a result.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Pick the simplest solution
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  One of the biggest challenges was the large number of simple “brochure” sites that were custom applications written from scratch, instead of using a common off-the-shelf solution. These were difficult for staff to maintain and keep running – often taking three different people to update a single page. In one case, we lost all of the content of a site due to it being built on Heroku using a database service that ceased to exist – we had to scrape the Internet Archive to get the content back. The main Sunlight Foundation website itself was one of the most complicated applications that Labs had created, pulling data from seven different databases – each one a completely different type (including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo, Redis, Memcache, and others) – to deliver the content.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Since Sunlight would no longer have any dedicated technical team, keeping these running wouldn’t be viable. After discussing with the rest of the staff, I picked WordPress as a simple platform for people to be able to manage the content moving forward. We picked WPEngine for managed hosting, so staff could rely on them to handle any technical issues that might arise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  For future projects, I would recommend that developers avoid reinventing the wheel – especially if all that is required is a simple content management system. Working with your staff to identify the needs of a project and finding the simplest solution helps to ensure that things will work long after the developer of that project is gone or is too busy to help. And in most cases, one database is plenty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  … But plan for the worst
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  A constant pain point was that the architecture of Labs’ software used individual, huge servers that hosted critical pieces of infrastructure shared by all applications, with almost no redundancy. This meant that when the only DNS server or database server went down, most of our applications all failed immediately. This happened several times over the few months while we were shutting down Labs.  This also meant that servers were consistently under-utilized while being incredibly expensive – the monthly AWS bill was over $6,000 per month!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  A little bit of extra redundancy can go a long way. Moreover, designing your architecture with small “atomic” pieces can reduce shared dependencies and provide greater stability. This is usually cheaper than running huge servers as well. Running one application per server is a good rule of thumb for smaller tools, and you can always split out services (databases, task runners, etc) as your needs grow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  As a quick aside – over the years, the number of servers I’ve seen fail due to logs filling a hard drive is astonishing. Spend the time to learn how to use tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html&quot;&gt;logrotate&lt;/a&gt; and set up your servers so that something simple doesn’t take down your application.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  The final steps
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  When the time came to shut things down and transfer content, we had the help of many partners. Most notably, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; was incredibly helpful in scraping all of our content from a list of sites we provided. Their fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/301works&amp;amp;tab=about&quot;&gt;301Works project&lt;/a&gt; took our our in-house url shortener domain name and a spreadsheet of our links, to preserve those forever so we were able to shut it down entirely (see above about not reinventing the wheel).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  One thing that made the transfer process much, much easier was services such as Heroku and Namecheap which allow you to easily transfer a property to a new owner. For both of these, you simply need to provide a username and the transferee needs only to accept – it’s a very straightforward process. GitHub proved to be more complicated, as we first had to add the new owner as an admin of the repositories and then have them manually move the repositories to the new Organization owner – this took a while with so many repositories moving over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Amazon was the most difficult piece, as we had to create AMIs of our EC2 instances (a very slow process with the aforementioned huge servers) and then grant access (by account number) to the new owners. I was never able to grant access to an S3 bucket to a separate account – whether the documentation is out of date or there was a system bug, I’ll never know –   for most of these I just made the content public wherever possible and sent out links.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  Wrapping up
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
  We should always hope that our projects don’t suddenly come to an end without warning.  But we also must plan for the future as it our work may stop tomorrow. Taking steps up early in a project can help to make sure your work lasts beyond the length of your involvement, and that it can be used by as many people as possible. Make sure you invest the time now, so that you won’t need to later.
&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The End of the Second Act of Civic Tech</title>

  <content type="html">
    &lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. This article contains broad generalizations, and is intended to get some new conversations started. There exists much anecdotal evidence contrary to many of the points below. I’ve also attempted to use “we” below frequently, as I have fallen into many of these same pitfalls as anyone else! Many of the ideas and suggestions below are not new, and are definitely not my own. I’m hoping this leads to more long-form pieces on many of these topics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. At the time of writing, I was an advisor at The Sunlight Foundation, previously was Lead Developer at The OpenGov Foundation working on Madison, and for years was a core contributor to The State Decoded. My opinions were/are my own, as are my biases from this experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of civic tech has changed radically in the last few years. Many of the old bastions of transparency and civic innovation have started to crumble, shrinking dramatically in both size and scope. It’s clear that the future of civic tech will appear radically different – moving out from under the umbrellas of sprawling nonprofit organizations and back into smaller, focused efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I discuss what we’re currently seeing today, and what will need to be done in the future for us to continue our work effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;For my purposes here, “civic tech” (as well as “us” or “we”) broadly includes the many organizations working on transparency, open data, and/or services that impact government, in the intersection between policy and technology development. Many of these are nonprofits, as we discuss below, but there are for-profits that are being impacted by the changes discussed here. This term also includes the many independent projects, people, and groups working on these problems to improve government. Groups within government working on these efforts could be included, but they have largely been sheltered from the effects I’m talking about below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;banner&quot;&gt;I’m also largely talking about the United States, though many of these topics apply to international groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;Josh Tauberer provides us a good definition of the first and second “acts” of civic tech&lt;/a&gt;, which I am reusing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you don’t want the history lesson, just jump down to &lt;a href=&quot;#what-you-can-do&quot;&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end-of-the-second-act&quot;&gt;The End of the Second Act&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 20th, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;Sunlight Foundation announced that it is officially closing down Sunlight Labs, downsizing, and considering how best to further its mission through potentially merging with another organization&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the future of dozens of technology projects uncertain. This follows on the heels of OpenGov Foundation discontinuing most of its work on America Decoded, its open-law project &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimorecode.org/&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://administrative.sanfranciscocode.org/browse/&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marylandcode.org/&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/code-for-america/an-open-letter-to-the-code-for-america-brigades-2949c2efec28#.rokslc2hf&quot;&gt;Code for America ceasing direct funding of its Brigades&lt;/a&gt; after previously having shut down &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.codeforamerica.org/companies/incubator-accelerator/&quot;&gt;its technology incubator program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major funders of many of these and other organizations in the space have also been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/whats-next-for-the-ford-foundation/&quot;&gt;changing how they’ve been funding&lt;/a&gt;. Frustration with projects that are not completed on time and within grant budgets have created an apparent wariness in funding opportunities from many. Some others simply no longer wish to fund transparency efforts, especially at the federal level, believing that transparency is no longer an achievable –
or even good
– goal. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12732252/against-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/07/how-american-politics-went-insane/485570/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Government, at all levels from city to federal, has also stepped up significantly in recent years, hiring more and more technologists in-house to solve problems from the inside, seemingly bypassing the need for civic tech entirely; of course, many of these hires came from the civic tech world outside of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days of million-dollar checks for “new” or “cool” ideas are effectively over. In some cases, the criteria these funders have chosen for evaluation of projects’ success – such as the number of “likes” an organization has on Facebook or Twitter – seem woefully out-of-touch with the work of advocacy organizations. Moreover, the funding cycles of these organizations are relatively short – a year or two at most – while it may take five or ten years at least to have the long-lasting impact many nonprofits aim for. This all has contributed to a lack of a clear path for relevant goals and sustainability for many organizations –
and even small projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the mere merit of having a project labeled “civic tech” simply isn’t enough to justify piles of cash and free reign to use it. If anything, the failure of much of the civic tech movement can be attributed to a strong lack of experience, oversight, and planning. The larger nonprofit world, especially on the service and advocacy side of things, has been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_model&quot;&gt;logic models for program evaluation&lt;/a&gt; for decades –
but this work has gone largely ignored in the civic tech community. Even within the few for-profits that have emerged, impact analysis frequently takes a back seat to promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, most projects are started without clear goals, realistic evaluation criteria, or even a firm concept of real impact. “Let’s put some things online” is, in many cases, as sophisticated a model as many projects ever reach; the actual people being served are an afterthought at best most of the time. Publishing tools and data for their own sake is a fine goal, especially those that support journalistic, educational, and research pursuits – all of which are critical to transparency efforts. But we should also stop to consider if our tools will help those who need them most, or if they merely will help the privileged, educated, and well-off – especially for those that are intended to impact equity and access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is more transparency having the impact on people’s lives that we want it to? Are we really engaging with the people and improving policy or are we merely talking to our friends? How do we know we’re making things better for everyone, working towards equity and not just paying lip service?
Simply put, we cannot know if we don’t talk to the people directly, and if we don’t have a way to study our impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/&quot;&gt;fantastic organizations&lt;/a&gt; following through, meeting people where they are – in churches, schools, libraries – but these are few and far between. A few more enthusiastic people with backgrounds in social work and degrees in nonprofit management would be hugely beneficial in our space.
At the very least, more time spent on outreach would improve just about every project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the technical limitations of many project teams hamper their long term success. The “anybody can do this!” attitude which pervades the civic tech community, while extremely democratic and empowering and wonderful for making the tent bigger, often results in many projects that are under-designed and lack foresight into technical sustainability. Meanwhile, just as many of our projects are the products of more experienced developers wanting to try out new, trending technologies – leading to us over-engineering solutions for niche problems written with ephemeral technologies. In both cases, any likelihood of reusability or sustainability is dramatically reduced by poor planning and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many problems being solved today by custom applications could just as easily be solved with a git repository, or WordPress site, or even just a spreadsheet on Google Drive. There are many fine projects that do not fall into these categories, but they’re few and far between. And there is an insanely huge amount of reinventing the wheel in our space, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mysociety.org/tag/poplus/&quot;&gt;despite efforts to the contrary&lt;/a&gt;. As developers, we must escape our own hubris to find the most simple solutions whenever possible, if our projects are to thrive. Engineering is hard; we don’t need to make it harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have largely forgotten that the purpose of all of this technology is not technology itself, but rather culture change. &lt;a href=&quot;http://longnow.org/essays/taking-long-view/&quot;&gt;Culture changes much slower than fashion&lt;/a&gt;, which is (sadly) our most common unit of time-measurement these days. It takes years to build the relationships necessary to change culture. But this is the work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buildwith.org/406-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buildwith.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s very attractive to work in silos, programming without doing the hard part of talking to people, but this isn’t a good way to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is not a value in a proof-of-concept. For many of the changes that the civic tech world would like to see in government or society, simply proving that it can be done is a very powerful tool. But tools should generally solve an immediate need for real people, not imagined “users”. And at the very least they should be used to start conversations, not to spin off new product companies. (There are certainly &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/why-we-hack-db430cb1aee0#.vok3ejoir&quot;&gt;other very good and valid reasons to hack as well&lt;/a&gt;.)
After you’ve done the work though, definitely consider finding ways to be paid for it – without money, nothing is sustainable. And though civic tech will always rely on volunteerism, it should not simply become a form of government &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nospec.com/&quot;&gt;spec work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://usopendata.org/2016/06/16/sunset/&quot;&gt;not everything needs to last forever&lt;/a&gt;. In many, if not most, cases, all projects should have a firm timeline, with waypoints for evaluation, and a date to cease operation. Having ways to measure real success and failure in terms of impact, with a real schedule, is absolutely critical for projects. Trying to make something last forever that was only designed to last a few months –
or simply not working – is a fool’s errand. Meanwhile, finding funding for a short-term project is vastly easier than one that will run indefinitely without clear goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there have been some incredible successes during the first and second acts of civic tech. The passing of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datacoalition.org/issues/data-act/&quot;&gt;the DATA Act&lt;/a&gt; though a bipartisan effort and countless hours of work from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/clearspending/data-act/&quot;&gt;The Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and other groups was a huge milestone towards openness and transparency. &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.resource.org/&quot;&gt;Carl Malamud’s tireless work&lt;/a&gt; has led to the opening of the SEC EDGAR database, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philanthropy.com/article/IRS-Unleashes-Flood-of/236822/&quot;&gt;the IRS’ Form 990 data&lt;/a&gt;, and much more. And most recently, the hundreds of civic technologists from Sunlight, the brigades, and elsewhere that have gone to work for government agencies have brought their passion to new innovation inside of government. &lt;a href=&quot;https://beta.fec.gov/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbeta.usaspending.gov/index.html#active&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-the-stage-for-the-third-act&quot;&gt;Setting the Stage for The Third Act&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of civic tech, given all of this, is very uncertain. Local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforamerica.org/join-us/volunteer-with-us/list-of-all-brigades&quot;&gt;brigades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://congressionaldata.org/&quot;&gt;volunteer groups&lt;/a&gt; have become in many ways the core of the movement. These groups have increasingly been working with government directly to introduce new tools and &lt;a href=&quot;http://drafts.wichita.gov/docs/draft-open-data-policy&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; to increase transparency and equity. These spaces will continue to foster new ideas for their communities, and provide a ready source of civic-knowledgeable technologists for government and nonprofits – this is critical for supporting the infrastructure of transparency. And rather than being fueled by grant funding, this work is largely due to the passion of thousands of volunteers all over the country (and world!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it’s also, in part, due to contributions from the private sector. In the same way that for-profit companies have sustained the open source movement for decades, so too are they stepping up to support the civic tech movement. Some companies provide direct financial support to brigades and community groups – paying for food and event spaces. Moreover, companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esri.com/&quot;&gt;Esri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govdelivery.com/&quot;&gt;GovDelivery&lt;/a&gt; are using open data, open source, civic tech as central parts of their platforms. This will only continue to grow as other funding sources become increasingly scarce and the interest in open data and transparency expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government is also changing to become more [civic] tech-savvy. The work of government units
such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/&quot;&gt;18F in the General Services Administration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usds.gov/&quot;&gt;U.S. Digital Services in the White House&lt;/a&gt; have impacted the Federal government in substantial ways &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/procurement/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/11/13/why-we-use-https-in-every-gov-website-we-make/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/07/08/openfec-api/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimorecode.org/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But moreover, this has created new enthusiasm in cities and states – causing an unprecedented rise in new CTO and CDO positions all over the country, and policies reflecting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendatapoliciesdecoded.sunlightfoundation.com/&quot;&gt;changing landscape of data needs&lt;/a&gt;. (As an aside, it’s noteworthy that many of these positions are being filled by former GIS data team members, a field where open data and civic tech has particularly long and deep roots!) Tools and data are more and more often &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law&quot;&gt;being produced in-house&lt;/a&gt; rather than outsourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another place I would love to see civic tech find a home outside of government is within libraries. I must say that this is idealistic, at best. In many places, libraries have become – and really, have always been – a bastion of innovation and civic focus &lt;a href=&quot;http://lil.law.harvard.edu/projects/caselaw-access-project&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chattlibrary.org/4th-floor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@danielschuman/a-rough-guide-for-librarians-on-opengov-42108199a4e4#.ibo8ydmbn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimorecode.org/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a very natural fit for both parties, and – most importantly – the people being served are physically present! There’s no way to avoid doing the work of meeting people where they are if you start where they are. Increasing investment in civic technology from libraries would be a huge boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;civic-organizations-project-owners-and-dreamers&quot;&gt;Civic Organizations, Project Owners, and Dreamers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any new projects just starting out, or years along their path, I would strongly recommend answering a few key questions before spending another minute on your work. You may have done many of these already, but writing them down and posting them publicly is to everyone’s benefit. They also provide a solid starting point to have an honest conversation with funders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify your outcomes – what do you really want to change as a result of your project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluate your impact – what measurements will you use to judge that your work is causing the outcomes you intend?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is the audience? Where are they? How can you meet them where they are? Be specific, think about who is in need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to your audience – what do they think they need, and how well does your idea match up?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long will the project run? What are the milestone for evaluation along the way? Set dates to evaluate your actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the real level of effort and cost for your project? Be realistic, think about the hours needed, not just to write code, but go to meetings, do user testing, and everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can you use the work of others to help you with your work? What tools, data, and research already exists in your problem space? Who else is already actively trying to solve this problem, and how can you work with them?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can you make your work reproducible? What can you put online and publish for other people to be able to make an impact using what you’ve learned? How will you license your work so others can use it? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/3410/_show_article&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/civic-techs-act-iii-is-beginning-4df5d1720468#.876qkg769&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/09/20/statement-from-sunlight-foundations-board-chairman/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimorecode.org/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to reiterate that last item – civic tech works best when we collaborate. Collaboration works best if we embrace radical transparency, to share all of our research, methodology, and findings with the world. Even our failures can become victories if it helps someone else to do things better the next time. And this is true in the for-profit world as well! A single vendor in a space will struggle, but fostering an ecosystem will drive more interest, demand, and need. Open data and open source help make more open data and open source!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;board-members-founders-and-executive-directors&quot;&gt;Board Members, Founders, and Executive Directors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your team.&lt;/strong&gt; They’re there because they believe in what you’re doing!
For an organization to grow and thrive, it must continue to change and evolve –
while still staying true to its principles. Stop and look at the shape your organization is taking, you may find that it has outgrown your old vision and become something radical and new –
and that’s ok! Don’t get stuck on one idea, be flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your team.&lt;/strong&gt; You can’t do everything, find people that you trust and let them do what they’re good at. When they give you advice, take it. If most of your advisors are telling you one thing and you believe another, it’s probably time to step out of the way and let them do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-officials-at-all-levels&quot;&gt;Government Officials at All Levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a government official, you’re probably already aware of what you must do. First, make sure you understand the open data and policy push that’s happening today. And then, get excited about it – find a local civic tech group or brigade and chat with them about your job, and hear how passionate they are! If you put a problem in front of a technologist, no matter how big or small, we will immediately start coming up with ways of solving it – that’s where our passion comes from. Get excited with us. Some of &lt;a href=&quot;https://esq.io/pages/about.html&quot;&gt;the most passionate people I know&lt;/a&gt; in the civic tech movement started in government, not as technologists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, start viewing your job through a lens of transparency. Ask yourself, in everything that you do, how can I expose this work? How can I share with the community the problems and solutions I encounter? What data can I share with the world – whether I personally find it interesting or not? How can I work with other departments to improve communication and share knowledge outside of my silo? Try to find an issue, something that you can push on and make more transparent, and follow through with it from start to finish. And make sure to tell the community about it! No matter how mundane, we love this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;funders-and-charitable-givers&quot;&gt;Funders and Charitable Givers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be a funder of nonprofit projects and organizations, first and foremost I ask you to renew your faith in the transparency and civic technology movement. We still have a lot of work left to do! And government can’t do it alone, small non-profits can’t do it alone. Innovation must be fostered from a variety of sources. And please keep in mind that this process takes a very long time! One- and two- year cycles are only long enough for a proof of concept, not nearly enough to effect real change.
Organizations desperately need funding for general support in addition to individual projects – the day-to-day stuff like meetings, promotion, calls, and outreach are all just as important to running an organization as the fancy new releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I encourage you to hold projects accountable to the criteria for organizations and projects listed above! There are real-world metrics of impact that can effectively track the progress of our projects, make sure you know what these are and so that we can better judge efficacy of programs. Hint: it’s not likes on social media – find real, meaningful ways of evaluating the work.
If you’re a board member, your task above and beyond everything else is to understand real impact, and not just numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And – in many ways the most important ask I have of you – be aware of your own, personal blindspots and work to expand them. There are thousands of good ideas that could improve the world today and just need someone to take a chance on them.
Just don’t get too distracted by every new and shiny thing – again, older projects still need long-term investment and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is only by working together that we can make the world a better place than we found it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
