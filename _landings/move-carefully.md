Well, my [little post on joining government service](/blog/2020/11/09/welcome-home/) attracted more attention than I ever would have expected! A lot of people had asked about stickers for the motto of that post, "Move Carefully and Fix Things." So, I had a run of 2-inch stickers printed up - and they look pretty good! Now I want to give them to you **for free**!

**Update February 6th, 2021**: Wow! In the first 24 hours of offering stickers, you all have made a bunch of donations and I've almost covered my costs! I'm always amazed at how generous the civic tech community is. Since I've basically broken even at this point, I'm updating the request process below to **ask everyone to donate directly to the charity of the month**.  Also, *I love stickers!* If you have stickers of your own, I'd certainly appreciate if you sent me some back as well! No pressure!

As of February 6th, 2021, the sticker fund is at *-$11.95*{: style="color: red"} (US dollars), and you all have donated **$50** to charity. So far, I've spent about $160 for 500 stickers (about $0.32/sticker), and another $23 on packing materials out of pocket. Mailing a standard, 1oz envelope to anywhere in the US costs $0.55, while international letters cost $1.20.


During pre-pandemic times, I'd just be going around handing these out at events. But today, it's a lot harder for me to give these to everyone. I also have no interest in going into the sticker business, so I want to try something _different_.

So here's the deal: **I will send you a sticker, or two stickers, for free, anywhere in the world.** Just email me your name & address at [hello+movecarefully@billhunt.email](mailto:hello+movecarefully@billhunt.email) and tell me if you want one or two stickers. That's it!

I'm not asking for payment for the stickers - instead I want to keep spreading the love, by asking people to donate to a registered nonprofit doing direct service work. For this month, I'd like people to donate to **[The Human Utility](http://humanutility.org/)**, a fantastic charity which helps people to pay their water bills. If you make a donation, you *don't* have to tell me about it, but if you *do* forward me a receipt, I'll add it to the total on this page!

I do appreciate it if you do want to help me cover costs, and you can send me some money via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/krusynth) or [Venmo](https://venmo.com/krusynth), but *please* don't feel obliged to send me money. **Any funds beyond my costs will be donated to the charity of the month!**

If you want more than one or two stickers, I'm happy to send you more! Either 1) send me something to cover my costs or better yet 2) donate directly to the charity listed above and forward me the receipt! If you want a *massive amount* of stickers, please [email me directly](mailto:hello+movecarefully@billhunt.email) and we can work something out! I'm happy to share the design files with people too ([CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) of course).
