Well, my [little post on joining government service](/blog/2020/11/09/welcome-home/) attracted more attention than I ever would have expected! A lot of people had asked about stickers for the motto of that post, "Move Carefully and Fix Things." So, I had a run of 2-inch stickers printed up - and they look pretty good! Now I want to give them to you **for free**!

**Update January 17, 2023**: We are well into our second printing of stickers, folks! Together we've donated **$1,795.75** to [The Human Utility](http://humanutility.org/)!

After two years of running this sticker program, I'm updating it! But you can still get free stickers while supporting a good cause!
