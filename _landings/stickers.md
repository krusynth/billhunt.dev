excerpt: I make stickers, and I'd like to send you some for free!

**Update 2025-07-29: Two new stickers have been added - Build Small Build Local, and I'm From The Government And I'm Here To Help! Stickers are getting more expensive these days, so these are LIMITED EDITION of only 100 stickers each! As a result, I can only send out one of each of these per person.**

![Four stickers: Build Small Build Local, small handwriting text on a yellow background; I'm From The Government And I'm Here to Help, bold white text on a black background; Govpunk, white text on a red eleven-pointed star with a black background; Move Carefully and Fix Things, with white lettering on a blue background.](https://billhunt.dev/uploads/2025/07/stickers.jpg)

It's been almost five years since my [little post on joining government service](/blog/2020/11/09/welcome-home/) generated a lot of attention and I began giving out **Move Carefully and Fix Things** stickers. Over all of that time, we've raised thousands of dollars for charity from people around the world - **and helped make a lot of people's lives better**!

Caring is Punk Rock, but the world is getting a little harder these days, and we all need to pitch in a bit more to help. Right now in the U.S., [the Trump Administration is cutting support programs for folks in need](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/us/politics/food-banks-trump-cuts-aid.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DE8.Pivl.8j0CGdxGHqdi&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare).

From now on, I will **only** be giving out stickers to folks who send me a receipt for a **recent** donation to a food bank or similar charity that helps those in need. As an alternative, I will also accept folks providing documentation that they have **recently** volunteered at a food bank. If you happen to live in a country that doesn't have food scarcity issues, find a similar good cause to support somehow and let me know.

Otherwise, the original offer still stands - **I will send you one or two stickers, at no cost to you, anywhere in the world.** Just email me your name & address at [hello+stickers@billhunt.email](mailto:hello+stickers@billhunt.email) and tell me which ones you want. But you *must* include proof of your donation or charitable activity.

I now have four different sticker designs which I'm giving out: **Build Small Build Local**, **I'm from the government and I'm here to help**, **Move Carefully and Fix Things**, and **Govpunk**. **Note that due to low stock, you must choose two different stickers, so everyone can get one.**

Now, I know lots of folks tend to donate food directly to these organizations, but food banks end up getting a lot of garbage they can't redistribute that way. (I still have nightmares about the endless cans of cranberry sauce that would show up after thanksgiving and sit around for years.) On the other hand,  The moral of the story is that it's **almost always better to donate cash to these organizations**.

If you want more than two stickers, email me and we can work something out! On average, it now costs me about $1.75/sticker to run this program, including printing and mailing and supplies costs.

Go be weird!
