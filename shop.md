Update 2024.05.08: The brand-new **SERIES THREE** designs have been added to the shop, just in time for the 10th anniversary of the DATA Act!!! All of my designs now come in t-shirt, long-sleeve, and hoodie versions, and plus-size options are available as well! They also come in a range of delightful colors!

Please note: I do not make any profit off of these items. All CafePress items such as shirts are sold at cost. I accept donations for the stickers I mail out personally, and anything beyond my costs is donated to charity. The best way to support my work is to tell people about it!

Cafepress manages all shop orders for shirts. They do all the work here, please contact them about any problems!
