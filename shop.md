**Update 2022.09.21: It looks like the earlier issue with checkout has been fixed - but please let me know if you have any problems!**

Please note: I do not make any profit off of these items. All CafePress items such as shirts are sold at cost. I accept donations for the stickers I mail out personally, and anything beyond my costs is donated to charity. The best way to support my work is to tell people about it!

Cafepress manages all shop orders for shirts. They do all the work here, please contact them about any problems!
