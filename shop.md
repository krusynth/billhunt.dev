**Update 09.17: at the moment, the CafePress shop appears to be broken! I've opened a support ticket, but in the meantime folks have been unable to finish the checkout process. I'll post on Twitter as soon as this is resolved!!!**

Please note: I do not make any profit off of these items. All CafePress items such as shirts are sold at cost. I accept donations for the stickers I mail out personally, and anything beyond my costs is donated to charity. The best way to support my work is to tell people about it!

Cafepress manages all shop orders for shirts. They do all the work here, please contact them about any problems!
