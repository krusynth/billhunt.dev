      As the Chief Enterprise Architect of the SBA, I helped to set the roadmap for technology across the organization. As chair of the Architecture Review Board, I worked with agency offices to ensure they were in compliance with Federal law, policy, as well as adhering to the enterprise-wide future state plans. This included the evaluation of new technology solutions, performing analyses of alternatives, and the rationalization of agency system and application portfolios.

    start: September 2019
    end: April 2020
    description: |+
      For my first six months at SBA, I served as the acting Director of IT Services, managing all of our operations and infrastructure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I led efforts to keep staff connected and working as the agency rapidly shifted to telework. I also supported implementation of cloud-based services for implementation of the CARES Act, enabling the agency to distribute over $350 billion in loans.

    title: Cloud Policy Lead
    start: September 2017
    end: September 2019
    description: |+
      As Cloud Policy Lead for the Federal Government, I collaborated daily with White House officials, Cabinet-level CIOs, and practitioners across the entire Federal enterprise to drive modern and mature practices in IT infrastructure for government services. To address the government’s largest barriers to IT modernization, the capstone of my work was creating the 2019 Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, “Cloud Smart.”

      In my first year at OMB, I received the prestigious Professional Achievement Award — an honor usually reserved for three years or more of exceptional service — for my innovative, collaborative approach to this work. In 2019, I was also named to the Fed100, after being nominated by my peers both inside and outside of government.

      In 2017, I served a tour of duty with USDS at the Department of Veterans Affairs, working to create Veteran-centric, modern services. During my time at the VA, I worked closely with the modernization teams on several initiatives and policies focused on user experience, including identity management & authentication, mobile application strategy, patient scheduling, and open data. This work included evaluation of new technology solutions, policy & user research, and stakeholder engagement ranging from Veterans to senior agency executives.
  - company: Sunlight Foundation
    title: Senior Technology Adviser

    end: November 2016
    description: |+
      The Sunlight Foundation is a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that uses civic technologies, open data, policy analysis, and journalism to make government more accountable and transparent. I served as Senior Technology Adviser through their board transition, working with the Labs Director to shut down their technology program (Sunlight Labs) responsibly. This involved rationalizing and open-sourcing our entire application and infrastructure portfolio containing dozens of applications and tools used by political journalists and organizations worldwide. I transferred our software projects to new maintainers, reengineered our entire IT infrastructure to use commercial off-the-shelf products, and open sourced all of our tools and data under open licenses for future journalists, researchers, and the general public to use. DC Legal Hackers named me Legal Hacker of the Year 2016 for this work.

    description: |+
      The OpenGov Foundation was a small, scrappy organization that worked to create policy and tools for open government and public engagement in law and policy. Founded by former Congressman Darrell Issa in 2013 as a nonpartisan organization to help the public fight the SOPA and PIPA legislation in the House, the scope of our work quickly expanded to open law and legislation efforts nationally and internationally, local to Federal. Acting as our CTO, I worked to grow our team and collaborate with officials at all levels of government to make the law open and accessible to everyone. I also evaluated business opportunities and new technology initiatives, and lead the development of our two flagship applications, Madison and The State Decoded, which are used by governments and organizations all over the world. Our clients included the White House, the United Nations, the Government of Mexico, as well state and local governments including Maryland, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and many others.

      As part of this work, I was an original member of the Free Law Founders, a national open-law organization of city & state officials and civic nonprofits working to drive open policies and standards. I also served as a subject matter expert on law and legal data to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Web Annotation Working Group.
