    I'm a civic technologist and policy enthusiast working for the US Federal Government. After over two decades leading award-winning Agile engineering teams building cutting-edge solutions for some of the best-known companies in the world, I turned my skills towards improving government.
  </p>
  <p>
    At heart, I believe in collaboration, transparency, and equity to make things better - teams, software, and government.

            <p>In 2017, I served a tour of duty with USDS at the Department of Veterans Affairs, working to create Veteran-centric, modern services. During my time at the VA, I worked closely with the modernization teams on several initiatives and policies focused on user experience, including identity management &amp; authentication, mobile application strategy, patient scheduling, and open data. This work included evaluation of new technology solutions, policy &amp; user research, and stakeholder engagement ranging from Veterans to senior agency executives.</p>

            <p>The Sunlight Foundation is a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that uses civic technologies, open data, policy analysis, and journalism to make government more accountable and transparent. I served as Senior Technology Adviser through their board transition, working with the Labs Director to shut down their technology program (Sunlight Labs) responsibly. This involved rationalizing and open-sourcing our entire application and infrastructure portfolio containing dozens of applications and tools used by political journalists and organizations worldwide. I transferred our software projects to new maintainers, reengineered our entire IT infrastructure to use commercial off-the-shelf products, and open sourced all of our tools and data under open licenses for future journalists, researchers, and the general public to use. DC Legal Hackers named me Legal Hacker of the Year 2016 for this work.</p>

            <p>The OpenGov Foundation was a small, scrappy organization that worked to create policy and tools for open government and public engagement in law and policy. Founded by former Congressman Darrell Issa in 2013 as a nonpartisan organization to help the public fight the SOPA and PIPA legislation in the House, the scope of our work quickly expanded to open law and legislation efforts nationally and internationally, local to Federal. Acting as our CTO, I worked to grow our team and collaborate with officials at all levels of government to make the law open and accessible to everyone. I also evaluated business opportunities and new technology initiatives, and lead the development of our two flagship applications, Madison and The State Decoded, which are used by governments and organizations all over the world. Our clients included the White House, the United Nations, the Government of Mexico, as well state and local governments including Maryland, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and many others.</p>
