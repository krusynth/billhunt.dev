[Gareth Branwyn](https://twitter.com/garethb2) and [Ben Morris](https://twitter.com/bengm) said [my site wasn't properly retro unless I had the <blink>&lt;blink&gt;</blink> tag](https://twitter.com/garethb2/status/1575246911862292481), but that's deprecated so I wrote a polyfill. Who doesn't love a good challenge?
