If you're building or even thinking about social networks, you really need to give this talk from [Erin Kissane](https://mas.to/@kissane) an hour of your time!
<br><br>
"The liberty of our work is not actually an adolescent freedom from caring what we do to other people, but the freedom to actually care as much as we fucking want to about the effects of our work in the world"
<br><br>
Reminds me of my favorite Tolstoy quote (via Gorky)
<br><br>
"Christ was free and so was Buddha, and both took on themselves the sins of the world and voluntarily entered the prison of earthly life. Further than that nobody has gone, nobody. And you--we--well, what's the good of talking--we are all looking for freedom from obligations towards our fellow men, whereas it is just that feeling of our obligations which has made us men, and, if those obligations were not there, we should live like the beasts."
