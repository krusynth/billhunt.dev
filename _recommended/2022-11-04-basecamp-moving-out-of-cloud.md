I generally don't like to repost DHH, but I saw this morning that Basecamp is moving out of the AWS Cloud because it's not cost effective for them. For those of y'all who have read my [Cloudbusting](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2021/02/28/cloudbusting/) and [Cloud Strategy Guide](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2021/03/07/cloud-strategy-guide/) articles, this should sound familiar.
