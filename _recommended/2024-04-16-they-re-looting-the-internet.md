This is a must-read piece from Ed Zitron describing how the major internet corporations have become actively hostile to users.<br><br>"It's the hallmark of a tech industry dedicated to creating problems that it charges you to solve, a sickly beast borne of venture capital and a lack of innovation. When you're rich and powerful, you no longer face real problems, and as a result fail to consider the solutions that would measurably improve a person's life."
