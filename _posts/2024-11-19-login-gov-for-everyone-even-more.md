excerpt: GSA has changed its policy and now Login.gov can be used by any U.S. government agency - federal, state, local, or tribal!
---

Back in August, [GSA announced that any U.S. government agency - federal, state, local, or tribal - can now use Login.gov](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2024/08/26/gsas-logingov-expands-services-into-states)!

If you're not already familiar, Login.gov is my favorite government shared service program. It allows government agencies to do identity verification for people once, and reuse that identity across a variety of services. So, for instance, you could use a single login to update your driver's license, get your social security benefits, or renew your passport.

Previously, GSA had ruled that non-federal agencies could only use Login if they were receiving federal grant money to do so, which severely restricted which agencies could use it. (I have to admit, this huge announcement slipped by without me noticing it, though this has been a policy change [I have been requesting for eight years](/blog/2021/02/18/login-gov-for-everyone/) in various official and unofficial capacities!)

Equally as exciting, [Login now supports full Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) compliance](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsas-logingov-announces-certification-of-ial2-10092024)! In short, this means that people's identities can be confirmed by using a combination of facial recognition technology and in-person proofing - that is, having someone physically check that the person matches their ID. Typically, IAL2 is required for any sort of government interaction regarding personal information, benefits, or finances, so this is a huge win! It also comes after a [rather brutal Inspector General audit](https://www.gsaig.gov/content/gsa-misled-customers-logingovs-compliance-digital-identity-standards) that had beaten up GSA on the topic.

This means wider access to Login.gov, and the ability to use it for more interesting things. The U.S. will probably never have a single "Digital Front Door" for all government services, like they have in the [United Kingdom](https://gov.uk). But login.gov brings us one step closer, and removes one of the most painful parts of dealing with the government - establishing your identity so that you can receive benefits.
