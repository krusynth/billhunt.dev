excerpt: "I've updated my old job tracking site, Job.Hunt.Works"
---

I know a lot of folks are out of work right now, so I spent some time to refresh my website to help keep track of what jobs you've applied for: [Job.Hunt.Works](https://job.hunt.works).  It's not a jobs board (like [the one I already run](/jobs/)), but rather a tool to keep track of where you are in the process for all of the jobs you are applying for.

I had originally created it years ago, back when I was out of work the last time, as an opportunity to learn React. For the refresh, I tore out all of that old React frontend, and replaced it all with vanilla JavaScript. I redid the theme from scratch, featuring lovely pixel fonts from [somepx](https://somepx.itch.io/).  The site now also features an inspirational message every day from the wonderful [Jacs Fishburne](https://www.jacsfishburne.com/)!

Try it out and let me know what you think!
