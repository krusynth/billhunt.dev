excerpt: As I look ahead to new projects in 2023, here's a quick review of the many things that I produced in 2022.

I realized that I don't do a very good job of writing full posts on here about my projects as I release them. So before I start on any new work for 2023, here's just a quick recap of the many projects I worked on (outside of work) this year:

* I launched my open source [Guide to U.S. Technology Policy](https://digitalpolicy.us/).

* I designed a series of [govtech t-shirts](https://billhunt.dev/shop/) and started a Cafepress shop to sell them.

* I started a YouTube stream where I play videogames like Satisfactory and Minecraft, [Enderprise Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/@EnderpriseArchitecture).

* I re-launched my [Public Interest Tech webring](https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/), and created a [webring template script](https://github.com/krusynth/webring-starter) so folks can make their own.

* I shut down my Twitter account, [moved to mastodon](https://mastodon.publicinterest.town/@krusynth), and wrote a [tool to look for your followers on mastodon](https://github.com/krusynth/twote). I also moved my [Policy Tweeting bot, EOPbot](https://botsin.space/@EOPbot) to mastodon.

* I started a new Mastodon community for public interest tech folks, [Public Interest Town](https://www.publicinterest.town/).

* I learned a bunch about [scraping RSS feeds using the Jekyll build process](https://github.com/krusynth/public-interest-tech-webring/blob/main/_plugins/get-feeds.rb), and deploying static sites with [GitHub Actions using cron](https://github.com/krusynth/public-interest-tech-webring/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml) to refresh scraped page content regularly.

* I created a [polyfill for the deprecated HTML `blink` tag](https://github.com/krusynth/blink-polyfill).

* I [redesigned this website](https://github.com/krusynth/billhunt.dev/tree/www) in the style of the 2000s era sites, and made a spooky Halloween theme.

* I later added a microformat-supporting [links page](https://billhunt.dev/links/) and associated [FOAF file](https://billhunt.dev/foaf.rdf).

* I created a [jobs board](https://billhunt.dev/jobs/) for govtech jobs and created a [mastodon feed](https://mastodon.publicinterest.town/@jobs) for that as well.

* I wrote a silly little [halloween-inspired cyberpunk horror story](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/10/23/bytes/).

* I gave my first in-person talk at a conference since the beginning of the pandemic, on [Managing IT Complexity](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/10/19/atarc-cloud-summit-2022/).

* I also continued to run my [free sticker program](https://billhunt.dev/move-carefully/) which has now raised over $1,700 for charity!

Amazing what you can do with some free time and a bunch of unfocused manic energy. A lot of this work falls under my concept of [Making the Web Weirder](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/09/03/redesign/), and in 2023 I hope to dedicate even more time to silly little projects to make the world a weirder and more delightful place!
