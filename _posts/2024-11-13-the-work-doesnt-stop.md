excerpt: This is my plea to my colleagues and folks currently working in, or thinking about, government service. The work to take care of each other doesn't stop with a change in administration.

Last week, voters in the U.S. overwhelmingly chose to re-elect 45. Personally, I am still reeling from the fact that so many folks chose to pick a candidate that calls for hate and violence and xenophobia. One that has promised to eliminate many of the liberties and benefits that folks hold dear.

I was hired into the federal government in the waning hours of the Obama Administration. I chose to stay during the 45 Administration - working for the White House on technology policy, and then running IT for the Small Business Administration at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. I've continued to stay on through the Biden Administration. And I'm not planning on going anywhere, unless I'm forced to leave.

In my early days in government, I saw many of my peers leaving in large numbers. A small number were political appointees or had term appointments that timed-out, but the larger number simply chose to not work for 45. I'm already starting to see the same thing happen again right now.

The oath that we take joining civil service is to our country, not to any specific president. Regardless of who is in charge, there's still work to be done for the American people. And they need us to work for them as desperately as ever. Even if the work becomes more difficult, even if there are more barriers, even if basic human needs are being politicized, the work we do can change lives, can save lives.

The U.S. government is often criticized for being a large, lumbering bureaucracy. Things move slowly, with numerous checks and balances and double-checks. There are requirements for things to be approved and sent to committees and re-approved. The more cynical among us have criticized these requirements, comparing them to the [CIA's Sabotage Manual](https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf) to reduce the efficacy of organizations. However, a positive feature of these processes is they make change harder and act as a safeguard against the quick and sudden erosion of our basic liberties and protections.

Fascism succeeds when folks give up. When they think they're alone and powerless. When they only look out for themselves instead of their communities. When they cede ground and hand over victories without opposition to their oppressors. It's said that for evil to win, good people simply must do nothing - or as we keep learning, good people just don't show up.

There remains the risk that 45, now as 47, will reinstate the [Schedule F](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/) conversion of many government employees, which would allow them to be fired without cause. By doing this, the administration can pack the government with people that don't question orders. But government is huge - these things will take time to implement, and many rank-and-file positions will be ignored entirely. In the meantime, folks shouldn't rush out the door to make it easier for the government to steamroll over our rights.

Right now, more than ever before, the government needs dedicated civil servants who believe in democracy, and can act as good stewards of government. Folks who know intimately the rules and laws and can protect our democracy and our fellow people. As I've said before, [**RTFM** is a superpower in government](https://digitalpolicy.us).

This is my plea to my colleagues and folks currently working in, or [thinking about](http://localhost:8000/jobs/?hot=0), government service. I will never criticize folks who cannot work in government or feel the need to leave to protect themselves and their families. But as to the rest of you - do not be a "fair-weather friend" to our country. If you are able, stay and do your job. It will be hard, but the work to take care of each other doesn't stop. Rather than choosing to not-work for 45, choose to work for the American people.
