There are a lot of articles right now telling folks to call their elected representatives or show up to protests or to do one-day boycotts, as ways of showing resistance to the current administration and the shocking things being done to the U.S. government and democracies all over the world. These actions are important, but they do nothing to address the *actual root causes of the problems we're currently facing*.

Congress is not going to save us. The courts are not going to save us. We can only save ourselves.

Our governments have been captured by oligarchs, who have accumulated power in many forms. Money is chief among those, but there's power in the control of information and goods and services - not to mention having elected officials in their pocket. These are **systems** of control, and we must take **a systematic approach** to tearing them down.

Voting is not enough. Calling is not enough. Protesting is not enough. Until we cut off their base of power, **nothing will change.**

Instead we need to talk about the very real and useful tools that the people have at their disposal to fight authoritarianism and fascism. I will describe them in terms of the U.S., but most of these principles apply wherever you are.

I will be clear upfront: the things that you must do to save democracy will be uncomfortable and inconvenient for most people. We have tied our own noose through the allure of comfort and convenience, and the only way out requires change and struggle.

First, let's talk about how we got to this point. [Take a look at these pictures.](https://sfstandard.com/2025/01/20/silicon-valley-trump-inauguration/) Those are silicon valley technocrat billionaires in the front row. How did they get there? Massive donations. How did they get the money for those donations? We gave it to them.

Don't make the mistake of thinking those men are there simply to kiss the ring - they have been working to undermine democracy and consolidate power for themselves.

We, the people, have been funding the collapse of our own democracy for over 40 years now. We have removed government restrictions on monopolies and private wealth, and this has allowed for the consolidation of capital under a small few individuals. But it's not just these individuals who are to blame. Looking at private donations to Congress, there are a vast array of private interest groups who now control our legislature on both sides of the aisle. Both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee have been captured by big businesses and big lobbies. Oil, banking, guns, drugs, healthcare - these groups spend an astonishing amount of money to prevent the people from having basic rights.

To fight back, to take the power back, we must retake control of capital, information, labor, and governance.

## Action 1: Stop Buying From Large Corporations

We have given these billionaires their money, so we must first cut off their access to capital. To do this, everyone must stop buying things through these huge corporations. And this isn't just a one-day blackout, this must be a persistent way of life from now on. A simple way to do this is to start buying locally for all items you possibly can, cutting out the chain of profits. Be wary, as many smaller shops online that appear to be independent often do fulfillment through Amazon or similar companies as well, even when it's not immediately apparent!

I know that it's not feasible for most folks to stop buying anything online or from a huge corporation for a variety of reasons. At a minimum, folks should be actively boycotting [these companies as much as possible](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/02/25/apple-shareholders-reject-ban-on-diversity-initiatives-here-are-all-the-companies-cutting-dei-programs/), including Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Walmart, Target, and Lowe's. However, many major retailers not on this list contribute to a number of dark money funds that support anti-democratic policies, so it's best to avoid spending at all national chains whenever possible. Again, the point here is to reduce the consolidation of wealth among a few global companies.

One further action you can take is to start buying things with cash as much as possible, to stop giving cash to payment processors and credit card companies. I've seen that a lot of small local shops have stopped accepting cash, especially indie coffeeshops and restaurants, so start pushing them now to change their policies! The companies quietly skim funds directly to lobbyists.

An additional action is to cancel your subscription to any newspaper or magazine that has been supporting anti-democracy efforts, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic. Many of these are owned and controlled by the terrible corporations above. You should also avoid getting news from folks on Substack, as that company skims off the top and gives that money to actual Nazis. Instead, consider getting your news from and supporting organizations like [404 Media](https://www.404media.co), [The 19th](https://19thnews.org), [The 51st](https://51st.news), [Mississippi Free Press](https://www.mississippifreepress.org), and [Wired](https://www.wired.com).

## Action 2: Move Your Money to a Credit Union

The financial crisis of 2008 was the direct result of shady banking and investments perpetuated by investment companies and banks. The government bailed out the banks instead of bailing out the people who lost their money because of them. So people lost their homes and executives made record profits. These profits continue to go to [lobbying on a variety of issues](https://readsludge.com/2025/02/26/congress-newcomers-hold-millions-in-stocks-tied-to-their-committees/). Many of these banks are now also cutting all DEI initiatives even though they have not been directed to, including Bank of America, CitiGroup (CitiBank), JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

Moving your money to [a small, local credit union](https://creditunions.org) keeps it in the local economy and out of the hands of lobbyists. You almost certainly have a local one of some sort, and usually the only requirement is that you're a member of the local community to bank with them. It's worth noting that very few credit unions back their own mortgages, and rely on larger vendors, so there might not be a better option on that front.

Ideally, you should also be moving as much of your retirement account funds away from individual stocks and mutual funds that support the companies listed above. Moving into government bonds will have a much lower yield rate, but that high interest rate is coming at the expense of our democracy, as this money goes right back into the same companies. At a bare minimum, divest from stocks in individual companies listed above, and divest from funds managed by terrible companies like [Blackrock who make their money on oil and slavery.](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/08/15/blackrock-is-a-modern-day-dutch-east-india-company-say-activists/) And do take the time to use your shareholder voting options whenever a vote comes up!

Also try to keep a decent amount of cash on hand. Finding tangible investments not tied to a particular currency that you can easily sell if things get tough is very practical right now as well, particularly if you don't trust the government - there's always money in gold and guns, even if the [dollar collapses due to a Ponzi scheme](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/), or the FDIC is shuttered and banks become insolvent.

Whatever you do, do **not** invest in crypto, as this is an unregulated market where scammers are not being prosecuted. Anyone can take your money and they likely will not be investigated. Dump your crypto investments immediately.

The world is facing increasing economic uncertainty - which is a nice way of saying things are getting bad fast. Markets are falling and unemployment is surging. Be prepared for the worst, by putting aside a little extra money each month. Don't splurge on vacations and trips right now. A little extra cash is also useful if your union strikes, or if there is a call of a **general strike** - these are the most powerful tools we have!

You can find other great ways to be frugal, for instance...

## Action 3: Host Spaghetti Dinners

Begin hosting regular - monthly or weekly - spaghetti dinners for your friends **and** neighbors. Compared to the other actions, this one is relatively easy. The main point of this is to build and reinforce real-world connections with people around you. These in-person networks will be critical for the work to come, particularly for direct support of others who may be in need.

The second point here, is to practice frugality while still being able to socialize. Spaghetti is cheap and quick to make, which is why it's a primary choice for small, local fundraiser dinners for churches and fire stations. You can get as simple or fancy as you want, pasta from a box and sauce from a jar is fine, and it's easy to make for a variety of dietary restrictions including gluten-free and vegan.

You can get folks to bring side dishes, salads, freshly baked bread, drinks, or desserts. This becomes a community event without having to go out to a pricey dinner.  To feed a group of eight shouldn't cost you more than $25, but you can certainly spend more if you'd like - keep it simple and cheap, so you can focus on building the connections.

Do make sure it is a *regular* event. You might have a standing Friday night event as one evening to not go out and be home with friends instead. Repetition is key to maintaining connections.

An additional action here is to try to mix it up and have different folks hosting and cooking, and invite new people as you go, to keep growing these networks. These in-person connections are critically important so that you can ...

## Action 4: Get Off of Corporate-Owned Social Media

These platforms influence opinion, generate massive revenue through advertising dollars, and control the flow of information. Even [staying on these platforms](https://johnoliverwantsyourraterotica.com) and not posting causes harm, because they receive advertising dollars both due to the number of views, as well as based on the number of subscribers.

They have a lot of capture right now because folks feel compelled to stay, since their relatives are still on there, or work colleagues, or their local neighborhood group. However, This is a self-fulfilling prophecy - neighborhood groups and relatives will stop using them once more folks start to leave.

Meta controls Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, Musk owns Twitter, TikTok is largely managed by the Chinese government - and there are very few alternatives. Many folks are moving to Bluesky, but that company is starting to flirt with venture capital funding, which means *inevitably* it will become as bad as the others. There is Mastodon, but that's an overly-complicated mess for the average person. Better to just talk to folks directly.

To that end, plain old text messages on your phone are amazingly insecure and easy for anyone to get access to, especially foreign and domestic government agents. WhatsApp is owned by Meta too, and they build backdoors into their systems. Telegram is owned by Russia. [Signal](https://signal.org) should be your preferred messaging platform, as it is built for security and messages are encrypted

## Action 5: Get Directly Involved

An huge action you can take to apply pressure is to [run for something](https://runforsomething.net)! Many local government elected positions are uncontested, and even if you don't win, at the very least having more opinions in the conversation leads to better outcomes and more diverse voices being heard. You don't even have to spend a lot of money, just submitting the paperwork is easy.

Outside of elected positions, your local government has many, many open boards that you can volunteer on without needing to be elected. These can be an easy entrance
into government and understanding how things work. From these seats, folks can often have niche powers to support their communities.

There's also the critically-important work of [volunteering as a poll worker](https://www.eac.gov/help-america-vote) or [election observer](https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/poll-watchers) to help protect elections.
