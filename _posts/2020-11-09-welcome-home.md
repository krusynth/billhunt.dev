I see many of my former technology-colleagues now suddenly eager to
return to government- or join for the first time- and I'm very excited
to work with you all again! That being said, here are a few thoughts
from someone who stuck around for the hard parts over the last 4
years.

Update February 6th, 2021: This little post has gotten way more attention than I ever could have expected! If you'd like to show everyone that you also want to **Move Carefully and Fix Things**, I'd like to send you a sticker **for free**! [Here's how to get yours!](/move-carefully/)

Update February 14th, 2021: This post is now a [free downloadable print-and-fold zine](//billhunt.dev/uploads/2021/02/welcome-home-zine.pdf)! You can find folding [instructions at the bottom of this page.](#instructions-for-the-zine)


This post originally appeared as [a thread on my Twitter
account](https://twitter.com/krusynth/status/1325804228426805248).
I've reposted it here for posterity with additional context. This was
originally a very short thread, but if you want to delve deeper into
these topics, I highly recommend reading [Cyd
Harrell](https://twitter.com/cydharrell)'s
fantastic book, [A Civic Technologist's Practice
Guide](https://cydharrell.com/book/)

1. "Move fast and break things" failed. As a result, we inherited a
lot of fast-moving broken things. Sustainability is the most important
principle in government tech today. **"Move carefully and fix
things."**

2. "Build with, not for" -
[Cuán McCann](https://linktr.ee/buildwith)

    *(that one is still the most important and gets its own tweet)*

    Note: Cuán's talk at CFA Summit in 2014 begins with "At the
    risk of creating a massive existential crisis..." and the following
    five minutes created one for me. It completely changed how I look at the
    world and approach The Work.

3. Technology is *almost never* the solution to the problem. You need
a deep understanding of culture, policy, budget, acquisitions, etc. to
be successful. We don't need **ANY** more shiny new websites or
hackathons. Your first year should be spent understanding the
systems.

4. Fam, choose boring tech over shiny. Those mainframes and COBOL still
work just fine after 50 years of service. Those React apps you're
writing are legacy before they launch, at a hundred times the cost, and
no one can run them when you leave - making them abandonware.

5. Government doesn't need disruption, or even innovation. Many of us
who came in as "innovators" are now the career bureaucrats just
keeping the place from burning down. Listen to our expertise and work
with us.

6. People don't want to hear this, but... this isn't a job for
tourists. Building relationships to cause change takes time. If people
know you have one foot out the door, they're not going to trust you.
Think about what you're willing to sacrifice before signing up.

That all being said... Welcome Home. I'm looking forward to
collaborating with you all soon.
