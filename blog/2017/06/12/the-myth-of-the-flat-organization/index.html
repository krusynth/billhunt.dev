      Over the last few years, an increasing number of technology companies and agencies have adopted a flat hierarchical structure. This organizational system promises to improve the efficiency of organizations by removing management structures, leaving as few management layers as possible.

      Since the popular game company <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf">Valve published its employee handbook online in 2012</a>, companies have looked to the text for ways to improve their own processes. Growing companies stopped hiring middle level managers, project managers, and other critical roles in favor of letting engineers manage themselves. This was a very attractive move for smaller organizations, since it reduced the number of positions they needed to hire for, reducing their operating costs dramatically. For engineers it can be initially compelling to be able to set their own priorities amongst themselves — and potentially get an inflated title such as “Lead” or “VP” (but often with no additional compensation).

      In a flat organization, it is no one’s dedicated job to handle many of the complex human interactions that a business must handle. At one organization, I found myself staying up late nights, writing human resource policies, vacation plans, and codes of conduct. From project management to conflict resolution, functions that are filled by dedicated staff in other businesses frequently become after-hours extra labor by engineering staff. So-called soft skills and human-oriented problems are treated as secondary to achieving product goals.

      It may be necessary for staff to serve multiple roles initially for very small organizations to be able to function, but beyond the first dozen staff this is not a practical or ethical way to accomplish tasks. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="374bc14350c4 8bfc99121ab3 anon">If you’re large enough to be thinking about insurance plans and snack delivery, you’re large enough to hire management.</span> A good project manager or human resources officer is a much better investment than that a lavish office space will be.

      People, by nature, surround themselves with like-minded — and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">like-cultured</em> — individuals, creating echo chambers and consolidating power in in-groups.

      Although I was initially very excited about the prospect of flat organizations, I have yet to work in one that was effective. Modern business practices and the laws that govern them have mostly evolved to help create a more level playing field for employees. Although tech culture fetishizes rule breaking, disdain for authority, and meritocracy, these only contribute to the very toxic culture that has evolved. For the good of our industry, we could all do with a few more rules — and a few more managers.
